They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.": "terrified", "Did you suffer any injuries?": "afraid", "No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.": "ashamed", "Why did you feel guilty? People really shouldn't drive drunk.": "ashamed", "I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.": "annoyed", "Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places": "afraid", "Yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience": "devastated", "Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?": "afraid", "Yeah he was punished hes in jail still": "furious", "I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together": "surprised", "sorry to hear! do you have any idea about the break up? did you think about it ?": "embarrassed", "Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world": "lonely", "sorry again! hope you'll get relief from this sadness. Please concentrate on your interests to divert your mind from this.": "sad", "I couldn't wait to go to the concert.": "excited", "Which Concert?": "surprised", "The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!": "surprised", "Wow, that's awesome! I have never been to an actual concert.": "surprised", "I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors": "sad", "Ugh, those articles always get me too... :( What was wrong with her? ": "annoyed", "she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying": "caring", "Jeez! Its so unfortunate... very sad really. ": "sad", "yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors": "trusting", "so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up": "sad", "That is nice of you.

They must miss you, too.": "sentimental", "I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident": "furious", "That isn't very nice.": "jealous", "Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.": "sentimental", "Yes. I do not have a Facebook.": "lonely", "Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.": "annoyed", "So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer": "annoyed", "Thats horrible.": "devastated", "Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!": "lonely", "Yes I do not like walmart.": "nostalgic", "Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed": "surprised", "My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!": "faithful", "Thats horrible. Did you tell on him?": "furious", "I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!": "caring", "Thats a tough situation.": "sad", "my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house": "content", "I guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted, lol. But it doesn't last forever and is worth it. ": "nostalgic", "i totally agree with you!": "jealous", "That's a full time job raising a human": "annoyed", "hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country": "lonely", "Oh, I'm sure you are lonely. Maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?": "lonely", "i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms": "lonely", "That's a good idea! This way you can also meet friends for yourself, but also maybe meet new friend's for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!": "lonely", "I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.": "annoyed", "oh man. i'm all about discipline! I don't like spoiled bratty kids": "ashamed", "Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!": "disgusted", "yes, i've heard some parents don't ever say no to their kids. makes no sense": "disgusted", "I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died": "terrified", "ok": "afraid", "Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy": "terrified", "I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.": "nostalgic", "Did things end amicably? I hope everything is good now!": "confident", "Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.": "sad", "I understand that, I hope things work out well for you both in the end!": "hopeful", "Thank you! That means a lot.": "content", "One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.": "nostalgic", "That is a very blessed day. It is something you will never forget.": "grateful", "Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.": "content", "Yes, I couldn't agree more. It is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change.": "impressed", "Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!": "grateful", "I bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened.": "anxious", "Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.": "hopeful", "Oh I'm sure. I would not like to be in a situation like that. Good thing everything worked out for you.": "apprehensive", "Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend": "grateful", "Oh really? What happened with your family and friend then?": "trusting", "My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be ": "caring", "Oh wow, that's awful. Stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what you've got and to not take it for granted.": "surprised", "Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you": "surprised", "I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.": "surprised", "I agree, someimes we just know": "annoyed", "It is a \"knowing\" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.": "content", "exactly, i get that entirely!": "apprehensive", "I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best! ": "surprised", "That's great! How did they surprise you?": "surprised", "I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there": "embarrassed", "That is so sweet of them, I hope you enjoyed it!": "caring", "I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely": "lonely", "Awww, That sucks man. Hopefully they don't say mean things to you about being lonely.": "lonely", "Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes": "lonely", "Well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone. I think you will too.": "lonely", "As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.": "surprised", "Yeah that is always odd to me, before they can talk they are already unique!": "surprised", "One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!": "surprised", "That is how it goes, sometimes you can just figure them out immediately": "terrified", "The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.": "guilty", "I understand that one,they are my favorite place to eat": "disgusted", "Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.": "annoyed", "That has happened to me too many times to count": "surprised", "I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family": "sentimental", "That must have been and intense and emotional moment for you.": "sad", "Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him ": "ashamed", "Uau, what a surreal moment.I always believe kids have a lot to teach us.": "sentimental", "My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!": "faithful", "I'm sure it will! I didn't get along with my dad until i became an adult.": "nostalgic", "That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?": "nostalgic", "Yes it did. I believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together. ": "surprised", "But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!": "grateful", "I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.": "ashamed", "Where you not secure in your self?": "anxious", "Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!": "surprised", "You can track her down to say sorry, or would that be creepy?": "terrified", "Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I \"friended\" one another.": "sad", "Wow, so your going to take being a bad person to the grave. Maybe you'll see her in the next life?": "sad", "I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.": "impressed", "Lucky you! That is rare. Maybe one day people will think of you like that?": "faithful", "That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?": "surprised", "I have something totally different. My boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader. ": "annoyed", "That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?": "jealous", "Well I've been in the business all my life and have worked for some great people. So I pull from what I learned from them.": "confident", "My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!": "surprised", "It's crazy how quickly kiddos grow! Even in a few weeks time! Do you see your friend and her baby often?": "surprised", "It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.": "annoyed", "That is how life goes! Different schedules and demands -- I'm sure she's so thrilled when she *does* get to see you!": "excited", "Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!": "disgusted", "Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!": "proud", "Wow, that is an amazing accomplishment!  Congratulations!  You gotta be feeling like you're on top of the world after that!": "proud", "Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!": "impressed", "My first thought was \"California\" but then there's Venice [Italy] and then either way, that's an amazing destination!": "surprised", "We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)": "impressed", "Oh, wow.  Not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!": "content", "I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.": "impressed", "I'm sorry to hear that! How did you find out? ": "sad", "She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.": "sad", "That's a real bummer, but as they say, there are plenty of fish in the sea!": "annoyed", "I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.": "apprehensive", "I feel the same way.": "content", "How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!": "annoyed", "I practice boxing. I love to punch the sandbags.It is very therapeutic.": "confident", "Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)": "embarrassed", "One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.": "sad", "Oh no that is terrible!  How did your daughter take it?": "furious", "She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.": "trusting", "Oh poor thing.  I hope she is doing better now.  Losing a pet is extremely hard!": "sad", "I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!": "nostalgic", "ooo they are gonna love it, just its expensive, I remember when it was only $20 to get in.": "surprised", "Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!": "nostalgic", "Which one are you going to California or Florida ?": "excited", "California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.": "nostalgic", "I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.": "nostalgic", "Cool.  Somethings never change.  What did you reflect upon?": "nostalgic", "We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.": "jealous", "Yeah, I miss my dad.  He died several years ago.  What kind of car is he looking for?": "sad", "Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!": "impressed", "I'm trying to get into it. we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything. Do you have tips? ": "prepared", "Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.  ": "surprised", "My big thing is i'm like O' I may need that leave it out of the tote box. Before I know it I have more stuff laying around then when I started.": "anxious", "I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.": "annoyed", "Well, sometimes people are busy and don't have the time to check emails": "lonely", "It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?": "apprehensive", "Text and emails are still the best option., until a nw way is created.": "surprised", "I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.": "furious", "Isn't that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?": "jealous", "I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.": "angry", "Maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again, you can try to approach the topic from another angle.": "embarrassed", "I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!": "lonely", "Congratulations! Where did you travel from and where did you end up?": "surprised", "From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!": "surprised", "That must have been quite the culture shock, glad it all worked out though!": "surprised", "One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.": "jealous", "I know, that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot.": "surprised", "That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.": "grateful", "Yea for sure, I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way. When's the last time you have been really disappointed? ": "disappointed", "Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.": "guilty", "I totally understand why he was mad. Why did you tell her?": "furious", "Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess": "guilty", "I guess he wanted to be available if she needed him.": "surprised", "There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!": "caring", "What is a back neighbor? And that is crazy!": "annoyed", "Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us. ": "guilty", "Oh my! I'm glad she apologized!": "ashamed", "Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.": "hopeful", "I understand. I am think the same thing. What is your health issue?": "anxious", "Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?": "grateful", "Yes, we should try to yourself heathy": "anticipating", "Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.": "sentimental", "Oh, it sure is, I feel the same way. They grow up so fast! ": "nostalgic", "Are your kids adults now?": "lonely", "One of them is! I have an 18 year old and a 12 year old.": "nostalgic", "I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!": "sentimental", "I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!": "confident", "I bet you were beautiful on that day. :) I hope that confidence has carried on since then!": "confident", "I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.": "sad", "It would be hard to replicate that day for sure, but I bet you have a lot to be confident about. You got this!": "confident", "My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a \"regular\" income.": "content", "I bet it's tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better. ": "content", "We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.": "grateful", "Your so lucky. Insurance is my number one worry every month. ": "grateful", "I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.": "sad", "I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected": "nostalgic", "Oh ya? What happened?? I'm intrigued": "surprised", "Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.": "surprised", "Woah plot twist. She brought him along to meet you? ": "surprised", "I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.": "trusting", "My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!": "excited", "OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?": "excited", "We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!": "prepared", "PCB is where we always go! If you want to drive a little bit, go to HUNTS in PCB - it's off the beaten path but THE best seafood and prices - just go early (like 4oclock) for dinner or you won't get in!!": "anticipating", "I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.": "disappointed", "Why didn't you go?": "lonely", "Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!": "surprised", "Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?": "lonely", "Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!": "terrified", "Did he do anything to you and your mom?": "guilty", "Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!": "trusting", "I am glad that nothing happened.": "terrified", "Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.": "embarrassed", "No, you didn't tell me! What happened?": "embarrassed", "She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!": "angry", "Oh no! Is she okay?! Don't beat yourself up too much, you couldn't have ever imagined that she had been in an accident.": "ashamed", "Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party! ": "embarrassed", "What happened?": "terrified", "Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.": "disgusted", "I love Fireball.": "nostalgic", "Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?": "surprised", "No, what happened?": "embarrassed", "Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT! ": "excited", "Thats horrible. Will they reschedule?": "furious", "You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...": "annoyed", "Who, tell me!": "surprised", "My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!": "terrified", "Wow, what happened?": "embarrassed", "Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!": "surprised", "That is very nice gift. Did you bought anything for him for Father's day?": "surprised", "I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!": "surprised", "That is great.": "grateful", "I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!": "confident", "Oh what job was the interview for?": "confident", "This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?": "impressed", "I think you got it man! Congratz!": "surprised", "Did I ever tell you about the time I \"got taken hostage\"?": "terrified", "oh my  are you really serious?": "afraid", "As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!": "terrified", "I am very glad it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit scary": "grateful", "I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!": "trusting", "Oh no, what did you do?": "embarrassed", "I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.": "surprised", "Did you ever tell your friend?  ": "guilty", "This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!": "surprised", "Oh no, I hate when that happens. I can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer": "embarrassed", "Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!": "trusting", "I wish refrigerators would have a warranty that replaced food when they went bad.

I can see why you are proud. Sounds like a hard working young lady!": "proud", "That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))": "surprised", "Yes, I was the same way too! I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!": "surprised", "Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.": "surprised", "Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!": "annoyed", "Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.": "prepared", "Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)": "embarrassed", "Yes me too Now if everyone would just take our lead lol": "surprised", "WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!!

Do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?": "hopeful", "We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.": "hopeful", "First time parent?": "disgusted", "Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second": "anticipating", "I love being in the \"flow\" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.": "confident", "What kind of work do you do?": "confident", "I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)": "impressed", "Actually I'm not, but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations, I would imagine it's also exciting and new every day.": "impressed", "That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!": "proud", "I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered \"better\".": "surprised", "I agree, its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas": "impressed", "It's just too many leaders want \"yes men\" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!": "afraid", "Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business": "lonely", "I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)": "nostalgic", "Baby belugas are cute, but not as cute as your baby!": "caring", "Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as \"Dot\", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.": "impressed", "That is so funny! I don't think she'll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. You'll have to remind her.": "sentimental", "This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt": "surprised", "That is great!!  Sometimes we mom's get a bit forgotten, so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling.": "nostalgic", "Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards ": "surprised", "Those words are the things we cherish more than any other thing, I love it when my girls do that!": "nostalgic", "THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?": "anxious", "I am not sure, it was pretty random": "lonely", "Did they give you any feedback?": "annoyed", "No, nothing at all": "afraid", "That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.": "ashamed", "I know": "hopeful", "So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.": "surprised", "That is exciting news!  I bet you were so surprised!": "surprised", "I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July": "surprised", "Ha!  What a neat day to announce it - did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.": "surprised", "Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting": "surprised", "Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?": "embarrassed", "I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?": "nostalgic", "Yes, I do. I recently watched the series \"Dark.\" It's the German one.": "impressed", "I haven't heard of that one.  What genre does it fall in?": "excited", "It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.": "excited", "Sounds interesting!": "impressed", "It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.": "confident", "I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.": "prepared", "Did it go your way?": "embarrassed", "Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.": "surprised", "That is great - have you found another job yet?": "surprised", " Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job": "confident", "Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!": "furious", "I hate traffic too, it makes me angry": "furious", "Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes": "annoyed", "People are so rude when they drive these days": "annoyed", "The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.": "afraid", "I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie.": "terrified", "And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.": "nostalgic", "That happened to me too.. with the other Exorcist movies and the Ring movies. Even though they scared me, I was too curious to not see the others.": "terrified", "My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.": "proud", "She sounds like a person with great ability. Great choice of friend.": "impressed", "She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.": "annoyed", "That's great. I wish I had someone so close like that!": "grateful", "I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.": "trusting", "Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.": "disgusted", "Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?": "apprehensive", "I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.": "anxious", "Oh, I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated.": "jealous", "I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too. ": "anxious", "I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out": "prepared", "Put what word ? You mean published the info?": "hopeful", "Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!": "excited", "So what breed did you get ?": "caring", "When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them": "grateful", "I would be too! You did what you had to do!": "embarrassed", "Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed": "proud", "Do you find the home buying experience worth it?": "surprised", "Yes, it was well worth it!

He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.": "jealous", "You shouldn't, because that is  a very stressful job": "apprehensive", "Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.": "furious", "And don't forget how many years they have to study in order to get a license for surgery": "anxious", "True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.": "proud", "I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future": "faithful", "Really? Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? I know sometimes it's tough to settle on a path.": "hopeful", "I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path": "anticipating", "That sounds like a great career plan. You will be filling a very important role in the physician's practice!": "confident", "That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?": "disgusted", "I'm not sure. What would you do?": "apprehensive", "You could chat to them and complain!": "annoyed", "Maybe I will try that. Do you think it will work?": "apprehensive", "Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are. ": "trusting", "One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.": "trusting", "Oh no, that sounds like an awful situation. What did you end up doing after that?": "ashamed", "I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.": "caring", "So exciting! It can be fun to have a roommate": "excited", "She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.": "surprised", "I love that. Lots of new friends, haha": "excited", "I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.": "surprised", "Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood": "nostalgic", "I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot?": "surprised", "I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era": "nostalgic", "Where I grew up didn't have one nearby so I get a little jealous hearing about it.": "surprised", "The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.": "nostalgic", "Good lord you must have had Facebook for a LONG time! I started mine in college so there isn't anything from my younger years.": "nostalgic", "Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.": "nostalgic", "Oh ok lol. I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!": "nostalgic", "How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.": "nostalgic", "I am 33 :)": "sad", "Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.": "nostalgic", "I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.": "annoyed", "Me too, bullies are part of the reason that I homeschooled.": "terrified", "Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?": "caring", "Well, I was referring to my own kids. They have adjusted well at 17 and 19.": "surprised", "I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.": "surprised", "I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.": "impressed", "Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.": "afraid", "Yeah it was so boring. Even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it,": "lonely", "My parents keep taking my money": "annoyed", "That's not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it??": "annoyed", "They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.": "jealous", "Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts, so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5, $10) save it and be strict not to spend it.": "surprised", "So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a \"mommy\" will come along to clean up after them?!": "disgusted", "LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the \" You are an adult not a child\" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed, then you have to deal with the consequences. ": "annoyed", "LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)": "annoyed", "Okay, it wasn't just one, it was three: One cherry, and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh, the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like, I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids, I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would, but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now, lol": "surprised", "The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.": "sad", "Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. That would be incredibly hard. What happened?": "sad", "She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.": "sad", "That's horrible. I'm really sorry about your friend. ": "sad", "It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.": "sad", "That's a beautiful name! It's cool you honored your friend in that way.

I've never lost anyone super close to me yet...": "sad", "A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time.

I don't have one now and use Uber and Lyft all the time.": "annoyed", "We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!": "surprised", "That is incredible! I swear some things in life are determined by fate. I'm glad you were able to get a car.": "grateful", "Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind. ": "surprised", "It's incredible, and so important. That's why I try to pass on the kindness whenever I am able.": "caring", "Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.": "surprised", "Yes.My first was when i turned 18.": "nostalgic", "That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year. ": "nostalgic", "LOL.You had to beg your husband for a surprise party??": "surprised", "Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops. ": "surprised", "It was raining hard one night and the power shut off": "annoyed", "Did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see?": "afraid", "Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles ": "prepared", "Well atleast you have something to help you guys.": "guilty", "One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam.

I can't imagine what you must have went through.": "devastated", "I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.": "nostalgic", "That must have been really hard. ": "proud", "It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.": "nostalgic", "I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.": "impressed", "Really?  What kind of work does he do?": "impressed", "He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.": "impressed", "Wow.. that is impressive.  Are you guys still friends?  Maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.": "surprised", "I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.": "guilty", "Awww... reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that.  What was the necklace all about did you make it or something?": "nostalgic", "I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said \"Special Sister\". I'm probably a jerk..": "surprised", "Well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  Did you pawn it?": "embarrassed", "No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.": "surprised", "Thats sweet of them. Maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.": "surprised", "Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?": "nostalgic", "All the time.  That is part of listening to music I suppose.  The songs remind you of when you first heard them.": "nostalgic", "Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..": "nostalgic", "I know what you mean.  However, the older I get the more I want to go back LOL.": "nostalgic", "lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)": "nostalgic", "I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.": "sad", "Oh no!  What happened to it?": "embarrassed", "It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(": "devastated", "So sad!  I am sorry.

The best option is to stop eating them in any form of food": "annoyed", "You don't care for sushi that much?": "surprised", "I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!": "embarrassed", "Damn that sounds like a pretty good one!

I don't know what to do with my life.": "lonely", "I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???": "sad", "I don't think so.

I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.": "sentimental", "That will be better. Talk to her before you lose her": "sad", "I am very lucky, my friends are so great.

He's so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be.": "apprehensive", "I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.": "impressed", "Yeah, I am sad about the whole left vs. right thing in general. Ultimately we should all be uniting against the corrupt people that are running amok in the government. ": "furious", "I am now going to be a master's student.

She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.": "annoyed", "I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone, wondering if she'd show up. At least, it sounds like, she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?": "annoyed", "Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!": "furious", "That's good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest I've waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour, and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out, but I did feel worse for her than for all of us.": "guilty", "I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!": "joyful", "Ahhh!

When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.": "afraid", "That is a smart idea. Sometimes I would have no choice, but to keep going, bacsue of having to drive to work.No matter what the weather is.": "annoyed", "When my parents got divorced when I was a kid, it was one of the hardest things for me.": "sentimental", "I understand your pain.

Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice": "content", "It's a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by.": "annoyed", "People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life": "prepared", "I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.": "impressed", "That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people": "trusting", "Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal.

I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!": "disgusted", "Aw, poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or, are you still afraid of them?": "terrified", "My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said \"You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that.\" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)": "afraid", "Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow, what a cool thing to say!  ": "surprised", "I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.": "ashamed", "We get carried away with our emotions sometimes. Did you explain it to them?": "sentimental", "Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.": "surprised", "I'm glad you're not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity.": "ashamed", "I do look at that as a strength, in anyone.

Hurrying around!": "surprised", "Yeah, that can be annoying especially in Walmart since so many people go there. It stresses you out when you don't need it to.": "annoyed", "Yes!

Have you ever had an interview like that?": "confident", "I have not. What is it?": "afraid", "It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company.

They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.": "disappointed", "Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that! It doesn't necessarily mean it went bad, though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?": "disappointed", "I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.": "embarrassed", "Keep your head up! Job hunting is usually stressful for most people. You got this!": "hopeful", "I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.": "jealous", "I'm not jealous of my co-worker though?  What makes you think i'm jealous?": "jealous", "You said that you were envious of his promotion. It is understandable though.": "jealous", "I didn't say that.": "guilty", "Okay, I am glad to hear that you are no longer feeling jealous.": "jealous", "I just got a puppy, but I have to leave him at home while I go to work. I feel so bad.": "guilty", "That would be sad, do you keep him in a cage?": "sad", "Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.": "annoyed", "That's nice, what does he enjoy watching?": "impressed", "Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.": "ashamed", "Absolutely. Although the world isn't so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?": "annoyed", "If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.": "faithful", "I agree. Stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!": "furious", "My dog disappeared while I was away at college.": "sad", "That's so sad, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?": "sad", "My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.": "sad", "My goodness, that sounds like a tragedy. I'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours.": "devastated", "Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.": "sad", "I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!": "anticipating", "Do you have some big plans for the visit?": "joyful", "Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby. ": "surprised", "Uh oh, have you ever delivered a baby before?": "guilty", "Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors! ": "anxious", "Oh right, I am a doctor.": "anxious", "Oh cool! What kind of doctor?": "hopeful", "I am a baby delivering doctor!": "anxious", "Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.": "proud", "What was the accomplishment again?": "impressed", "My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.": "impressed", "Wow, that's amazing. What made her want to go back to school?": "impressed", "I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.": "sentimental", "What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?": "disgusted", "Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.": "afraid", "What's been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?": "annoyed", "A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.": "afraid", "Oh no! I hope it didn't fall on anything or anyone!": "embarrassed", "No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.": "grateful", "Oh thats really nice! Its important to help each other out when things like that happen!": "caring", "I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.": "impressed", "Who??? Male or female.Actor or singer?": "jealous", "She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.": "faithful", "Please tell me who she is!!!!!": "surprised", "Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.": "disgusted", "Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!": "nostalgic", "I know exactly how you feel, I've been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything.": "embarrassed", "Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!": "nostalgic", "Hahaha yes, you are so right. Then again, I'm a Christian so I am also comforted when I remember that we have a real, more important and awesome life to look forward to one day.": "joyful", "That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.": "nostalgic", "Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.": "sad", "Wow, that's terrible. Was anything stolen or damaged?": "furious", "Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.": "disgusted", "What a story, it's just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals.": "embarrassed", "I woke up this morning, and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.": "disgusted", "That is is awful.Did you call the cops": "furious", "I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.": "terrified", "You should install security cameras outside your house.": "afraid", "I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.": "apprehensive", "That's rough man. Got any back up interviews lined up?": "sad", "Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.": "hopeful", "I hope that you hear back from them soon. It ain't going to be rough forever - someone has got to recognize your worth eventually!": "sad", "Last week, my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.": "embarrassed", "Oh no, that is terrible! What happened? What did you do!": "furious", "I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed. ": "embarrassed", "I am so sorry that happened to you!": "devastated", "I love my cat, but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.": "disgusted", "Yuck, sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!": "disgusted", "She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles. ": "annoyed", "Well, at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that.": "disgusted", "I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!": "excited", "Oh really?! Where you headed too?": "excited", "We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!": "anticipating", "Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isn't it? ": "annoyed", "I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.": "disgusted", "Did you have a severe diarreia or something?": "afraid", "Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.": "annoyed", "I am sure your friend will forgive you.": "guilty", "I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy, proud": "proud", "Oh cool! How did you win it? ": "proud", "It was for a chess competition. ": "proud", "Oh cool! I love chess! What did you win? ": "proud", "They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?": "jealous", "I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself": "annoyed", "Wow that's annoying, my husband is always telling me about his co-workers being the same way. ": "annoyed", "Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.": "annoyed", "Yeah I see what you mean. Hopefully he might realize eventually.": "disappointed", "I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.": "anxious", "Sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone.": "anxious", "Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.": "disappointed", "Well, a wise man said that having patience was a virtue, I think you're becoming a more virtuous person by waiting.": "trusting", "I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around, and people laughed at me.": "embarrassed", "I think you should always focus on your strength then it won't matter who is there and what they say": "hopeful", "That is good advice. I feel better about this.": "guilty", "Also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help. Next time  go with someone you know": "lonely", "I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.": "surprised", "That's great, how wonderful! I hope y'all had a good time.": "impressed", "It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.": "nostalgic", "How great, I'm glad to hear that.": "grateful", "I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!": "disgusted", "How old was the child?": "sentimental", "She couldn't have been older than one!": "jealous", "Wow, that's awfully young for that kind of thing.": "disgusted", "I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly, it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do, even though I put my best work and most effort into it.": "surprised", "Oh that's not good. It is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere": "disappointed", "It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.": "hopeful", "Sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated": "confident", "That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!  ": "excited", "I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone, I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.": "trusting", "Oh no! Are you going away this weekend?": "sad", "Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.": "apprehensive", "Hopefully, she answers soon. Maybe she's taking a nap or is in the shower.": "annoyed", "I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday": "jealous", "I am in the same boat, but I think that I can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of I have. ": "content", "That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks": "annoyed", "How funny! I know how you feel though. I have always been poor.": "embarrassed", "ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair": "furious", "Happiness is within and I seek that all the time. Even rich people are sad and unhappy. ": "sad", "That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.": "hopeful", "I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.": "disappointed", "Why? How did that happen?": "afraid", "Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere. ": "afraid", "That's so sad. I feel sorry for you. ": "sad", "I feel sorry for me too!": "sad", "Yeah. Do you have back up plans for this issue?": "annoyed", "They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them": "faithful", "That's nice, I'm glad you feel that way.": "grateful", "Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?": "hopeful", "I do feel that way, I try to always have a Christian attitude.": "hopeful", "Do you follow any particular denomination?": "nostalgic", "I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up": "grateful", "That's nice of her! It's always good to have friends to fall on": "surprised", "yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money": "grateful", "Oh, that's even better. That's truly a friend you can rely on. You're very fortunate.": "trusting", "I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard, but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.": "surprised", "Skateboarders have some serious skills! I can barely walk a straight line.": "proud", "I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.": "impressed", "We all have different talents. Mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol! ": "impressed", "I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!": "disgusted", "Maybe you could try to better that?": "jealous", "I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them": "jealous", "You could start a trend.": "hopeful", "I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(": "caring", "He will make it": "hopeful", "I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky": "caring", "It will help eventually": "disappointed", "I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.": "terrified", "That must have been scary. It could have gone really badly.": "afraid", "Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.": "caring", "I hope the owner knows better next time.": "sad", "I just recently finished potty training my dog, that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.": "disgusted", "Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!": "caring", "I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!": "sad", "For sure! It is much like potty training a kid. Actually I think dogs are easier then kids lol!": "joyful", "My dog started looking really sick and in pain, but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet, so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.": "annoyed", "THat is stressful.  Are they ok?": "hopeful", "Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.": "caring", "That is really good to hear": "grateful", "I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?": "content", "I certainly do.  Lucky to be healthy and able": "confident", "I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?": "content", "Good question.  I am thankful to be able to park my car in my garage!": "grateful", "Oh I can agree with that completely! ": "disgusted", "I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.": "confident", "I hope you get the job! What was the position you applied for?": "hopeful", "A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!": "hopeful", "That sounds like it pays nice?": "content", "Have you ever had to file for disability?": "devastated", "No. Why do you ask?": "guilty", "I've had to recently. Its been really tough.": "sad", "I'm sorry to hear that. How far along in the process are you?": "sad", "Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?": "annoyed", "I actually do not have any kids right now": "nostalgic", "My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.": "impressed", "I heard that was a really fun game though!": "nostalgic", "I've had to help take care of others before as well.": "caring", "Seems like we all have. Some people shirk having to though.": "caring", "Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.": "caring", "Oh no.I hope she gets better.": "sad", "I failed my driving test twice, but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.": "disappointed", "Well that's good, sometimes it's our failures that really show us what we're made of. ": "surprised", "I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.": "confident", "Congratulations. I am in my twenties and still can't drive so hopefully I will get my license next year.": "confident", "I once went a restaurant, and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen! ": "disgusted", "Did you say anything to someone?": "angry", "I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?": "disgusted", "a Burger King near me got shut down for that!": "surprised", "Do any of your kids play any sports?": "impressed", "No, I do not have kids. Yours?": "afraid", "My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.": "impressed", "I bet you were really proud!": "proud", "I was so late for work one day, I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!": "embarrassed", "Wow. Thats hard to believe lol.": "surprised", "I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.": "terrified", "Yeah, it sounds that way.": "disgusted", "I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.": "annoyed", "That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers, they are so slow sometimes.": "annoyed", "The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.": "furious", "Stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy, especially during rush our!": "annoyed", "I was so excited when I got my new puppy, it was awesome!": "joyful", "Man, I'm so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage, as tumultuous as it can be. There's just so much emotion and \"new feelings\" going on as you watch it grow.": "jealous", "I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!": "proud", "Yeah, but then there's also those late nights where you have to take them out because they're not used to holding their pee/poop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy, so it's hard to keep up sometimes, but also fun!": "disgusted", "Those were simpler times, I wish I could go back and relive those days!": "nostalgic", "What were simpler times?": "nostalgic", "Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.": "embarrassed", "Ah, I see. Had a great childhood, hu?": "nostalgic", "It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.": "content", "I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child. ": "surprised", "Congrats! That would be really exciting. What was your project?": "proud", "My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.": "disgusted", "That's a very interesting topic. I would have loved to have seen that!": "impressed", "I'm sleep training my toddler, he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad": "sad", "I know what that's like. I have three kids.": "nostalgic", "how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry": "sad", "They never slept in the crib lol. I won't even make my son get a haircut because he cries so much when the clippers get close. I'm the wrong one to come to for advice lol": "embarrassed", "I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there, it was so much fun! We really had a blast!": "excited", "That sounds heavenly": "content", "It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!": "surprised", "I envy you.  Have fun!": "jealous", "As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!": "sentimental", "Time sure does fly and change is inevitable": "disgusted", "Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.": "disgusted", "Thinking about past events can be very nostalgic": "nostalgic", "I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.": "hopeful", "what happened?": "embarrassed", "Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.": "annoyed", "time to find a new job it sounds like! good luck": "hopeful", "My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!": "proud", "Awesome! What is he in college for?": "proud", "He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.": "proud", "Holy goodness! That is really specialized. You should be very proud! :)": "proud", "We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!": "proud", "That is very good to hear, hopefully things truly turn around for him.": "caring", "I hope so. Do you have any kids?": "hopeful", "Not yet, i just have one dog.": "sad", "I went to the flea market last weekend!": "prepared", "Oh that's neat! Did you find anything good?": "surprised", "Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.": "nostalgic", "Oh I remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday! ": "surprised", "I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s. ": "nostalgic", "I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.": "surprised", "Wow, that's incredible. I don't even make my own bed. ": "impressed", "haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol": "impressed", "Of course... haha. Why doesn't anyone pay adults to make their beds?": "disgusted", "My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!": "disgusted", "Wow, that sounds very disgusting.": "disgusted", "It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.": "devastated", "I hope the baby rat is okay.": "terrified", "She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!": "caring", "My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned, but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!": "caring", "I'm so sorry but great to hear she is better now!": "sad", "Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!": "caring", "Well I'm glad to hear it's resolved.": "afraid", "I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.": "caring", "Oh that's nice, I love doing that. Did the cat seem happy?": "caring", "The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.": "trusting", "Well how nice, that must have been fun.": "surprised", "One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.": "afraid", "Wow that must have been scary!": "afraid", "If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!": "terrified", "How long were you lost for?": "sad", "I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway": "disgusted", "Wow back up there friend, what are you talking about?": "surprised", "I wish it never happened now. ": "nostalgic", "Context, what the heck are you talking about?": "surprised", "she was 8": "proud", "Seriously what the hell are you talking about??": "annoyed", "A little while ago, my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years, due to issues beyond our control, so I begrudged her trip a bit.": "surprised", "Being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response. Despite this, you never know what is going on behind the scenes, she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips.": "faithful", "Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do. ": "jealous", "I bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her. Instead, you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future.": "faithful", "I am so happy it's a boy": "joyful", "You just had a baby?! I didn't even know you were expecting!": "surprised", "He'll be here in about 3 months": "hopeful", "I'm so happy for you! Have you decided on a name yet?": "joyful", "Hey, I just started the keto diet!": "ashamed", "Good for you! I have heard many great things about keto. How are you finding it?": "hopeful", "It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.": "surprised", "Props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works. Some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast, but putting in effort goes a long way.": "jealous", "Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.": "prepared", "Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy": "surprised", "You must be over the moon happy.": "joyful", "I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha": "surprised", "Very funny. Have you decided on a name yet?": "surprised", "I just had my Sweet 16 party...": "surprised", "Happy belated Birthday! Did it turn out the way you had hoped?": "disappointed", "Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...": "surprised", "What did you get instead?": "guilty", "A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.": "devastated", "I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.": "surprised", "Really? That is a good move": "content", "I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!": "confident", "You have As because you have high interest in studying  ": "confident", "Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.": "proud", "Wow, that is truly incredible! What is your secret?": "trusting", "As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.": "faithful", "That is so true! You are a true weight loss warrior I think!": "proud", "I never liked milk growing up, because my family drank skim. ": "surprised", "Do you like it now?": "nostalgic", "Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!": "disgusted", "I like 2% as well.  It's perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!": "content", "I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.": "joyful", "Have you tried 1%?": "hopeful", "No, but I am satisfied with my choice. ": "content", "That's great.  2% is much more healthful than whole milk.": "grateful", "I just got back from our vacation, but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic, and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge": "anxious", "so very bad ya": "ashamed", "Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.": "sad", "Recently, I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.": "surprised", "Oh no! :(   How are you taking it?": "embarrassed", "It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.": "sad", "Dang.  Please don't blame yourself.": "embarrassed", "On my recent vacation to Florida, there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving!

The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.": "hopeful", "Oh no! I'm not sure how all that works, but I thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman": "ashamed", "Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.": "grateful", "Well I'm glad for you! And for him! A new life is exciting": "proud", "When my dog passed away, I felt so helpless.

It would have saved me from the mountain of debt I have now": "grateful", "We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!": "prepared", "Well, I've always been of the mindset that (if they can) they should help the first 2 years as that's usually the break-in period.

I've had so many problems with them over the years": "surprised", "Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.": "annoyed", "I know.

What do you have planned?": "anticipating", "We are going to eat tonight. Then tomorrow we are having a big surprise party with her best friend. I even had a couple of her friends fly into town that she hasnt seen in years.": "surprised", "I bet she is going to be so surprised!  Is she hard to surpise?": "surprised", "Yes she kind of is. I dont think she knows, but I can't really tell for sure.": "trusting", "Well I'm sure everything will go great!": "confident", "Once in college this guy I was just friends with asked me out to get ice cream.  I could tell he really liked me and I didn't want to lead him on so I told him I had a headache.  I know that he knew I was lying and I still feel guilty to this day about that!": "ashamed", "yeah that's tough. But can you imagine how bad you might feel if he had a REALLY good time on the date and really thought things were going somewhere with the two of you?": "disgusted", "Yes, I know thats what I was thinking.  I just don't know if I should have said the truth that I didn't like him that way instead of lying and saying I had a headache.": "ashamed", "That is true. Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint. ": "annoyed", "Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.": "embarrassed", "Oh wow, I have heard that can happen with that food": "disgusted", "Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'": "surprised", "Ha, that is funny": "embarrassed", "I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!": "disgusted", "ewww! that is just super gross dude!": "disgusted", "I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!": "embarrassed", "Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.": "disgusted", "I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!": "ashamed", "I would love to have that tv": "content", "Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?": "guilty", "Keep it, the guilt will go away": "guilty", "it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.": "annoyed", "Women these days. I don't think i'll ever understand them.": "embarrassed", "Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.": "annoyed", "Exactly, sometimes I think women like drama.": "guilty", "I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.": "nostalgic", "It must have been fun to catch up with them.": "impressed", "it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.": "nostalgic", "Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.": "sentimental", "I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.": "confident", "Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.": "hopeful", "Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!": "annoyed", "That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.": "terrified", "Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.": "grateful", "That's awesome. What are you going to do about it?": "excited", "Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!": "hopeful", "I'm envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?": "jealous", "My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness": "grateful", "oh i know friends like those": "lonely", "I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering": "sad", "i believe you": "surprised", "Thanks for your comprehension": "surprised", "Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.": "terrified", "Oh wow, sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?": "afraid", "By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.": "embarrassed", "Did you have any damage to your home?": "terrified", "I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.": "sad", "That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?": "sad", "No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed": "jealous", "I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?": "sad", "no it is an autoimmune disease": "sad", "Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken": "sad", "When did you get separated? By the way, that is terrible to hear.": "sad", "one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel": "afraid", "Why are you so down, my depressed friend?": "sad", "is that he loved her": "sentimental", "This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.": "disgusted", "Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?": "surprised", "Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.": "disgusted", "Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!": "disgusted", "I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.": "apprehensive", "I hate to hear that, what happened that made it end poorly?": "afraid", "We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.": "nostalgic", "maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.": "lonely", "If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!": "annoyed", "I know the feeling.": "hopeful", "You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.": "annoyed", "Leave a note on their door. and at the end put \"thanks in advance\" lol": "annoyed", "Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.": "annoyed", "Well, you can at least try. ": "guilty", "I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!": "angry", "You could get earplugs lol": "afraid", "I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!": "apprehensive", "Oh man! What happened to your hip?": "terrified", "I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!": "embarrassed", "Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?": "furious", "From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?": "disappointed", "If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks, it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..": "angry", "Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.": "disgusted", "Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it, botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!": "hopeful", "The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.": "surprised", "Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?": "anticipating", "I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.": "anticipating", "Nice! Mowing the lawn isn't fun in the heat unless you're using a super fast one of course": "excited", "Writing speeches makes me nervous": "anxious", "I agree, the writing part is easy part, but the speaking part is the worst!": "hopeful", "Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience": "content", "Maybe so, they say to imagine the crowd naked, but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part.": "jealous", "True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say": "surprised", "I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days, but they always bring back fond memories": "nostalgic", "Same. What are your favorites?": "surprised", "I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!": "impressed", "That's funny. I've also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!": "surprised", "Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react": "disgusted", "I've noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them.": "nostalgic", "Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything": "annoyed", "Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.": "jealous", "Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life": "content", "Yeah I get that. Where did you work?": "confident", "Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town": "disgusted", "Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!": "disgusted", "True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.": "lonely", "Yes , work is better with friends.": "lonely", "Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either": "annoyed", "Really? I'm surprised the only restaurant in town wasn't busy.": "impressed", "Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day": "grateful", "Did you see that happen today?": "embarrassed", "Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!": "angry", "That's pretty cool.  What a nice person.": "surprised", "Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing": "guilty", "Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking": "afraid", "Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?": "afraid", "I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill": "prepared", "That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?": "afraid", "Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed": "ashamed", "When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks": "embarrassed", "Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?": "embarrassed", "Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations": "annoyed", "Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation.": "annoyed", "I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong": "ashamed", "I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!": "surprised", "That's great.": "confident", "Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!": "surprised", "Congrats. I want a promotion at my job.": "confident", "How long have you been there?": "content", "three years.": "proud", "I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?": "apprehensive", "I think I'm just going to move on.": "hopeful", "My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!": "angry", "Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?": "anticipating", "Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.": "angry", "That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead.": "guilty", "If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*": "surprised", "I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!": "impressed", "Cool. Does that get a bonus?": "surprised", "I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*": "surprised", "That's awesome. ": "surprised", "I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.": "impressed", "Well now you know you're pretty great at your job.": "confident", "I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.": "disappointed", "So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.": "guilty", "Was he upset?": "furious", "He kinda gave me the \"Mom, really?\" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*": "embarrassed", "I hate when that happens. ": "annoyed", "I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].": "sad", "I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions": "anxious", "It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD": "prepared", "You are so right.": "content", "I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.": "ashamed", "Did you go back?": "embarrassed", "No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.": "embarrassed", "Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.": "annoyed", "Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*  ": "embarrassed", "Or you can get a variety pack!": "prepared", "Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!": "surprised", "My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.": "trusting", "That's nice. I could get that here.": "content", "I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.": "apprehensive", "Well now you know.": "guilty", "Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.": "anxious", "I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!": "confident", "Noice!  What was it about?": "surprised", "I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.": "prepared", "Very cool, are you a scientist?": "surprised", "Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.": "apprehensive", "I broke up with my boyfriend last week.": "guilty", "Oh no! That's awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasn't good for you.  How are you feeling?": "ashamed", "Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.": "lonely", "I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again.": "lonely", "Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.": "sad", "I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!": "hopeful", "Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?": "proud", "I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL": "surprised", "That's an important job though!  You're keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive.  I'm so happy for you.  Money is tight for me so when I hear someone getting a bonus...it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!": "hopeful", "This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!": "surprised", "I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!": "grateful", "I wish I could relate. I'm a male, so I'll never know the pain and/or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. It's such an impressive thing to go through, and no matter what, mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?": "jealous", "15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?": "faithful", "Yeah, I'll consider it. That's a nice thought. My brothers have had 5 kids between them, so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime, and they've given me lots of practice, but I'm grateful for that. 15 and 19, that's awesome. You're almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier.": "grateful", "Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)": "proud", "Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is, it": "hopeful", "It what?  Its way higher?  If that's what you meant to finish with then I totally feel you.  Especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much.  ": "content", "Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!": "angry", "It is ridiculous.  I found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesn't even sound fair to me.  It averages things because it can't specifically tell. ": "annoyed", "The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!": "excited", "Wow, school is right around the corner": "afraid", "It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks. ": "surprised", "Well that should relieve some stress": "annoyed", "The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.": "annoyed", "Everyone has those kinds of days, it happens": "embarrassed", "It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving. ": "embarrassed", "I am sure they have forgotten about it": "nostalgic", "really didnt want to anything for days": "lonely", "Why not? What was wrong?": "afraid", "I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it\".": "confident", "Aww I'm sorry. That's a bummer.": "sad", "it is indeed. wont happen again though": "surprised", "I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district\".": "impressed", "It sounds very motivational.": "impressed", "it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now": "impressed", "He must be a great speaker.": "proud", "I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time": "anxious", "What are you saving for?": "anticipating", "Baby is due in less than 3 months": "excited", "I am sure everything will be fine. Do not stress.": "anxious", "I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me": "anxious", "I hope you did well on it.": "confident", "5 months to find out !": "surprised", "Just hope for the best and don't worry.": "anxious", "I tried so hard for that exam, when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!": "confident", "That's great!  I'm happy for you.": "joyful", "thanks. now onto bigger things": "nostalgic", "What are those things?": "afraid", "starting a clinic": "anticipating", "it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting": "surprised", "That sounds so exciting! Congratulations!": "anticipating", "thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town": "guilty", "It sounds like you live in a great community.": "faithful", "I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this": "jealous", "Oh man. Hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!": "confident", "Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym": "nostalgic", "Nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return! ": "hopeful", "I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change": "content", "I understand that. I am the same way.": "jealous", "Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.": "content", "I cannot function if I eat anything other than my usual breakfast.": "disgusted", "I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline ": "proud", "Unfortunately, I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. ": "confident", "I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing": "surprised", "the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls": "devastated", "wow. When that happened?": "surprised", "Last week. we're in temporary housing now": "content", "Sorry to hear that. I hope your insurer will call you back soon.": "sad", "I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!": "annoyed", "It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this": "disappointed", "I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.": "embarrassed", "That is pretty sad and heart-breaking to see kids in such situations": "sad", "I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.": "annoyed", "Do you have plans to get together? ": "surprised", "Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.": "surprised", "How nice of her. You must have been so happy to see her.": "surprised", "I can't find another way to earn money": "jealous", "There are usually many ways, but it depends on what you want to do!": "content", "I just want to work from home": "annoyed", "Well, we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us": "apprehensive", "I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now": "anticipating", "That is so exciting.  what have you done to prepare": "prepared", "You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap": "embarrassed", "the buggy is important,  I have a baby boy of my own.": "anticipating", "I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials": "hopeful", "Do you have a baby one the way?": "surprised", "I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back": "grateful", "do you make enough money to support the baby?": "surprised", "She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.": "furious", "oof that is rough.": "sad", "Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors ": "sentimental", "those foids deserve it.": "furious", "I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding": "furious", "Yes, you only hurt yourself when you get angry.": "furious", "I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again": "guilty", "Give it some time, maybe she'll change her mind.": "surprised", "I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.": "proud", "thats so sweet of you": "caring", "She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.": "terrified", "oh yea i can imagine glad shes fine": "caring", "I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!": "prepared", "Wow. Do you expect to win?": "surprised", "I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.": "confident", "That is nice. Good luck.": "confident", "I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro": "nostalgic", "Nice, me too, are you playing Nintendo games?": "excited", "Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation": "proud", "I remember these game well, like Contra and Battle Toads. ": "nostalgic", "I was so scared of going onto the train!": "terrified", "Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?": "afraid", "No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.": "apprehensive", "Was it your only choice to get where you were going?": "apprehensive", "I am going to get us a new car!": "excited", "Great, what make are getting?": "excited", "I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota": "disappointed", "Toyota is reliable, are getting an SUV?": "trusting", "I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.": "nostalgic", "Interesting choice. Did she like it?": "surprised", "She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.": "sentimental", "That's good to have something in common. Make the memories.": "nostalgic", "I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed": "sad", "So what is the problem exactly?": "annoyed", "I just feel kinda stuck in life": "lonely", "Try doing something you never did before.": "embarrassed", "I had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!": "disgusted", "It is disgusting. What did you do?": "disgusted", "I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.": "disgusted", "You did good. You should have called the manager to tell him know.": "ashamed", "I finally got a new bike! I've been wanting one for so long!": "joyful", "There are so many bike trails available now. You are going to have a lot of fun.": "excited", "I hope so, my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.": "anticipating", "I'm glad you were able to get one that you are going to enjoy so much.": "surprised", "Pretty soon I'll be taking over my parents mortgage.  Homeownership is on the horizon.": "hopeful", "That's a big step. I hope it works out for you.": "hopeful", "A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.": "confident", "I like renovation projects. And yes, renting is a waste of money": "prepared", "I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating": "annoyed", "I feel you, I'm in the same boat.  Are you in a two income household?": "excited", "Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring": "ashamed", "Yep, money spent on bills and food, with little left for fun.  My wife has the same complaint. ": "annoyed", "I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS.": "caring", "Oh no, that sounds horrible": "ashamed", "Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.": "sad", "I am sorry, that is a sad thing to go through": "sad", "I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.": "grateful", "Why would you not get paid?": "jealous", "I can no longer prove I did the assignment.

This makes me so angry!": "furious", "You should get a mini fridge and put it in your room, with a lock on it.": "annoyed", "I think that's a great idea. I know where to get those fridges for cheap.": "annoyed", "Yea man go for it, don't procrastinate.": "disappointed", "I recently lost my sister to breast cancer. She was very young and has left three little girls. I have been devastated.": "sad", "Wow, that truly is devastating. I wish your family can make it through these hard times :(": "sad", "My parents health has deteriorated rapidly, and they refuse to go get counseling. It's very sad for me to see.": "sad", "If my sister died to breast cancer, I would be so depressed to the point of my health deteriorating too. :(": "sad", "It's why I think getting a counselor is so important. No one should be expected to go through this on their own.": "sad", "I was recently rejected by a person that I enjoyed. You can't always get what you want.": "disappointed", "Amen to that.Life is so unfair it's not even funny.": "furious", "Life is not fair, but it is also amazing in that we are here to begin with": "impressed", "Life is so complex.We had no idea of the design of that": "afraid", "I'm a little anxious about an upcoming move. It's to a *very* different state with a *very* different climate and way of life!": "anxious", "What is the state and do you like change?": "content", "We've been great with change, including a few overseas moves under our belts. But this is to Anchorage! I've read a lot, and there's a lot to be excited about -- but man, those looooong winters!": "impressed", "Oh that is all the way into the cold and wet wild! Do you have or will you think of getting sled dogs?": "anxious", "Ha! Not likely in the city....but hey...who knows! I WILL use the opportunity to finally learn how to cross country ski.": "jealous", "lol, right. You will have great fun!": "excited", "The economy has been doing well. The future looks bright.": "hopeful", "I agree!  Things look really good going forward.": "hopeful", "Hopefully prosperity will carry over into the next few generations.": "hopeful", "I hope so as well, especially for my kids sake!": "grateful", "My sister unfortunately will not seek help for her alcohol problems, and she will not even admit to them. I am extremely sad apprehensive about what might happen to her.": "trusting", "Im sorry to hear that , i hope she can find a way stop this before she spirals out of control": "sad", "I have been trying to get my family and her friends to have an intervention, but they have not agreed to it. She really needs one.": "annoyed", "She really does need an intervention , and family and friends would help greatly , i hope she can get her life back together ": "caring", "It was still so unexpected when my husband and I -- who were open to getting pregnant -- found out that we actually were!": "surprised", "Oh my god, that's excellent! Congrats!": "proud", "Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.": "nostalgic", "Oh, lol. Did you get to see any sharks at the aquarium?": "terrified", "The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!": "surprised", "Oh cool, yes that is very interesting. So how big were those whales in feet and the baby too?": "surprised", "The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!": "terrified", "I know how you feel! What did you watch?": "terrified", "I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.": "embarrassed", "It is a pretty good horror.": "afraid", "My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.": "proud", "That is very impressive. She going to make sooo much money": "impressed", "She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!": "proud", "Any employer would hire someone who went to Harvard in a heartbeat. You are a lucky parent!": "surprised", "My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!": "jealous", "Nice what kind of car is it they purchased?": "jealous", "They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.": "proud", "Ok that is a nice car what color is it?? ": "jealous", "I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!": "proud", "That is excellent, what did you major in?": "proud", "I majored in environmental engineering!": "confident", "Oh cool. Do you want to work as a scientist?": "impressed", "I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.": "guilty", "Sorry to hear about that.  I wonder if there's any way to fix this situation.  What do you plan to do?": "annoyed", "I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.": "apprehensive", "Coming clean is a great way to start.  It's hard since you know she'll be hurt.  Were you having trouble in the relationship before?": "anxious", "I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.": "anticipating", "When is the last time you seen them?": "excited", "I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.": "impressed", "That's awesome I hope yall have a good time!": "surprised", "I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.": "nostalgic", "Do you still talk with any of your older friends?": "lonely", "Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.": "lonely", "Do you have little time from working or other things?": "lonely", "I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!": "terrified", "Yikes what was it about?": "terrified", "A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.": "lonely", "creepy.  Were you able to fall asleep after watching it?": "afraid", "I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary": "sentimental", "That's great. I bet it is a very special place for you two.": "joyful", "Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.": "caring", "Sounds like a nice little place. I am glad you two have that spot to share.": "grateful", "I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.": "devastated", "at least Riley passed in their sleep. Hopefully they didn't suffer. i'm sorry you lost a loved one.": "sad", "Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much": "sad", "i have a big doofy mutt who is a 75 lb lap dog in his heart. i know the feeling": "caring", "I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.": "furious", "I absolutely agree. I really hope he doesn't win in 2020.": "hopeful", "We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.": "trusting", "He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!": "annoyed", "Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!": "sad", "Dang, that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?": "surprised", "Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.": "anxious", "Ah, gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!": "sad", "Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions": "sentimental", "I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!": "impressed", "No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance": "impressed", "Well, if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-)": "hopeful", "I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.": "disappointed", "That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.": "annoyed", "Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!": "ashamed", "There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :)": "afraid", "I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.": "disgusted", "I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?": "disgusted", "I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.": "sad", "That sucks, I hope you get it figured out!": "disappointed", "Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.": "grateful", "wow, it must have been quite an experience": "lonely", "It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!": "surprised", "My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe": "afraid", "Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.": "content", "I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times": "nostalgic", "Awesome. What breed did you own?": "proud", "A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse ": "embarrassed", "I love paints, and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping.": "sentimental", "Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work. ": "confident", "The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.": "furious", "10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own. ": "annoyed", "I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.": "surprised", "Practice makes perfect, or makes you fast in your case.": "confident", "One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.": "apprehensive", "I would be too! Did you to it?": "embarrassed", "Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.": "terrified", "So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did? ": "confident", "My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!": "surprised", "You must be so proud!": "proud", "I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.": "jealous", "I don't think you're being selfish, you're doing your best!": "lonely", "I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.": "proud", "I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!": "anticipating", "What state are you going to move to?": "sad", "Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!": "surprised", "Oh that is nice, will you be going skiing?": "excited", "I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate ": "content", "Who doesn't..  everyone should do it!  Have you ever had any mystic experiences while you did it?": "embarrassed", "No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy. ": "content", "I hear you can travel to different dimensions while meditating..": "lonely", "My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis ": "annoyed", "Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.": "afraid", "It must have being terrifying!": "afraid", "Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.": "afraid", "Tnank god! They should have let you know they where going to do the job.": "angry", "I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.": "disappointed", "That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.": "ashamed", "Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.": "impressed", "I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!": "disappointed", "I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.": "anxious", "oh, that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?": "anxious", "Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.": "surprised", "Better living through chemistry! I'm glad you made it through.": "confident", "I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!": "grateful", "That is really nice of him.  Did the other people get mad because they had to wait?": "surprised", "Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.": "surprised", "Lucky you.  Where I live people are not so nice.  Can I move there?": "hopeful", "Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!": "excited", "I am in Central FL... so uhh.": "impressed", "I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.": "disappointed", "I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.": "afraid", "Ouch, I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.": "embarrassed", "Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck": "annoyed", "Hmm, wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!": "embarrassed", "Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!": "disgusted", "So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.": "surprised", "Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.": "guilty", "But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!": "surprised", "I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.": "nostalgic", "Ah, I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-))": "terrified", "Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha": "trusting", "As long as you keep your playful spirit, you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness, but I can see it in you!": "content", "I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.": "impressed", "It's awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?": "confident", "I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.": "grateful", "That sounds like a lot of fun, it's so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring, so I'm happy you have that job!": "proud", "I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.": "annoyed", "What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?": "excited", "I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!": "faithful", "Silver linings do happen, maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.": "guilty", "Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.": "annoyed", "Maybe not a true friend after all.": "jealous", "Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!": "surprised", "I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.": "jealous", "I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!": "proud", "She won $5,000 and never offered to share. ": "surprised", "That's a lot of money, to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?": "jealous", "I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.": "confident", "Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?": "confident", "I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.": "confident", "Well done! You should be proud.": "proud", "I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.": "anticipating", "If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?": "ashamed", "Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on": "anxious", "Wow, that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?": "impressed", "I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!": "afraid", "What did they or the person do to you?": "disgusted", "Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.": "apprehensive", "Broom would be a good choice, hit them in the crotch, that will stop them.": "annoyed", "Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said \"Good morning. Can't sleep either?\" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!": "surprised", "My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.": "caring", "That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?": "caring", "Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?": "lonely", "No, I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However, I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.": "lonely", "I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.": "embarrassed", "Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?": "embarrassed", "There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.": "prepared", "I know you probably feel like you did a bad job- but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!": "confident", "Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!": "angry", "Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.": "annoyed", "Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe ": "afraid", "Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!": "annoyed", "I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.": "joyful", "That awesome! Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!": "proud", "I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?": "excited", "Yes, I have! It's a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! Best of luck to you!": "confident", "I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.": "afraid", "There is a big storm coming where I am living now. Did your power go out?": "prepared", "Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!": "terrified", "Oh I will. Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!": "surprised", "I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.": "disgusted", "I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad, especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind.": "sad", "Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.": "caring", "I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.": "disgusted", "It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.": "faithful", "My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.": "surprised", "That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?": "grateful", "I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.": "surprised", "Good job! Maybe you will get a promotion too!": "hopeful", "I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!": "anxious", "Which way are you feeling? Are you a thrill seeker?": "hopeful", "I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?": "excited", "Yeah I really like Six Flags. They have some great roller coasters. Have fun tomorrow!": "excited", "I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.": "grateful", "Keep it up. Soon you'll have enough money to buy a new house.": "jealous", "That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.": "prepared", "Exactly, it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected.": "prepared", "We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.": "surprised", "That's fun. Will anybody be dressing as Santa?": "prepared", "Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.": "embarrassed", "Maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as Santa! And all the kiddies will be amazed!": "embarrassed", "I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.": "sad", "that happened to me one. i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once. it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.": "terrified", "That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!": "devastated", "oh no. right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future.": "apprehensive", "I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.": "annoyed", "What types of tv shows do you like to watch?": "impressed", "Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.": "sad", "Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?": "caring", "Nah, I don't get to to bad.": "ashamed", "I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!": "anticipating", "Ive been to Busch Gardens before.  They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.": "terrified", "I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa? ": "afraid", "Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around. It was equal parts fun and scary.": "apprehensive", "Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.": "sad", "Yea, I agree. Or they just really don't care.": "annoyed", "This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.": "disgusted", "Did he even hesitate?": "trusting", "Not even a little.": "caring", "What a little monster!": "surprised", "I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.": "grateful", "Dogs are the best. are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?": "caring", "Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems": "caring", "Awww golden retrievers are adorable.  My ex had one of them.  Well I hope your dogs feel better soon.  Ear infections are no fun at all.": "caring", "I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house": "devastated", "That's intense! I hope the damage wasn't all that bad.": "terrified", "It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.": "devastated", "Yes, get it fixed as soon as possible. Does insurance cover it?": "furious", "Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.": "grateful", "I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.": "nostalgic", "Wow, you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back.": "nostalgic", "Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.": "nostalgic", "Well, I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!": "surprised", "I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.": "anticipating", "That sounds like fun, do you have a big family?": "joyful", "No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?": "surprised", "Yes I understand, I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time.": "sad", "I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.": "impressed", "Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?": "impressed", "She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.": "ashamed", "thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer": "confident", "You know you could still do it. I know you can.": "guilty", "yea you're right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot": "jealous", "My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.": "sad", "Aw, that's so nice of him! Does he live far away?": "surprised", "He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!": "grateful", "That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed": "trusting", "You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.": "apprehensive", "Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Don't recommend doing that, lol.": "afraid", "It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.": "apprehensive", "Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!": "anxious", "I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.": "disgusted", "Gross. It would have gone straight into the trash here.": "disgusted", "Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.": "disgusted", "You can use baking soda to get the smell out of it.": "ashamed", "Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.": "apprehensive", "Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.": "impressed", "That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?": "grateful", "It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.": "prepared", "I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?": "impressed", "I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her. ": "hopeful", "I'm sure she *loves* having both your presence and your support!": "surprised", "I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!": "lonely", "Wow, I can't imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting.": "afraid", "It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!": "surprised", "I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad, and I'm glad that you adapted well.": "grateful", "Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!": "content", "I think I might. It sound exciting, and I thank you for the encouragement.": "hopeful", "I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.": "grateful", "That's unfortunate, but I'm happy that you have a good support network to help you out.": "grateful", " Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.": "grateful", "I hope you recover well and I'm sure you will with good support by your side.": "hopeful", "I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.": "disgusted", "I completely understand that. Did something like that happen recently? ": "disappointed", "We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!": "hopeful", "Yes, I know how you feel. All we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference. I believe there is hope!": "hopeful", "Me too! <fist bump> ;-)": "terrified", "So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.": "angry", "Wow, that's a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?": "surprised", "He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.": "trusting", "Ah, maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone. ": "disappointed", "I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.": "annoyed", "It should be harder to get a license than it is.": "jealous", "I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?": "annoyed", "It's as if some people think they are the only one's on the road.": "afraid", "You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.": "devastated", "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. May I ask how long ago it was that she passed? ": "sad", "She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.": "sad", "They probably still just need some time. My grandfather still isn't over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago. I would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can.": "sentimental", "I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.": "hopeful", "I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.": "apprehensive", "Please don't ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.": "jealous", "Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too. ": "lonely", "Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think it's great that you're trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a go-getter, and don't ever give up!!": "hopeful", "One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.": "excited", "That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?": "proud", "She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year. ": "surprised", "As long as it is something she enjoys. I am sure you are very proud of her!": "proud", "June and July are very busy, June I prep plans for July. July I have company all month.": "prepared", "it has been really busy even for me at work , i feel your pain": "annoyed", "So much for relaxing during the summer?": "content", "I know right ? unfortunately for us those are the perks of growing up lol": "disappointed", "Do you even know how crazy it is to skydive? I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.": "surprised", "Oh I don't think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places. ": "afraid", "It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.": "surprised", "I think I would pass out from fear lol.": "afraid", "You should do it sometime. It's fun to take chances.": "hopeful", "I think the chances I take should be directly proportionate to the consequences of the actions.": "ashamed", "I have recently become vegan and I am very impressed with the food": "impressed", "That is interesting. Do you miss meat or dairy at all?": "disgusted", "I had to start eating this way because of health reasons and I have found some amazing recipes on Pinterest.   It makes me not miss meat or dairy at all": "disgusted", "That is good to hear. I wish you the best of luck with your new diet.": "content", "I have to get these shots in my head for migraines.": "confident", "I have to trust my doc completely that he has steady hands and will inject the nerve correctly.": "trusting", "oh man that sounds like serious stuff ,and it sounds really scary as well hope everything goes great": "afraid", "When my mom had breast cancer a few years ago. I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.": "caring", "That's terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?": "devastated", "I was and she was had a full recovery. ": "devastated", "That's great news. I don't know what I would do if my mom passed.": "proud", "Me neither, my mom means so much to me. ": "sentimental", "Me too. I'm glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.": "grateful", "Do you get to see your mom often?": "nostalgic", "Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.": "annoyed", "I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!": "impressed", "Those cars are pretty slick, what color was it?": "jealous", "It was blue with white racing stripes. ": "impressed", "Wow, one day I hope to have enough money for a car like that, that's awesome": "surprised", "Same here, they are pretty expensive. ": "jealous", "My dog chewed up one of my flip flops the other day. Now I have to throw them out.": "annoyed", "UGH my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes.": "furious", "This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town. I'm sorry about your shoes.": "furious", "I dont really like dogs for that reason.  They are fun to pet but taking care of them is a chore.": "caring", "My wife surprised me on my birthday with an amazing homemade dinner.": "surprised", "That sounds like you have a great wife.  What did she make you?": "grateful", "She made me ribs and a cheesecake for dessert. ": "surprised", "Yummy, You are making me hungry.  Happy belated birthday!": "surprised", "Thank you! What is your favorite meal?": "content", "I always love pizza!": "proud", "Me too, do you have a favorite flavor?": "content", "My long term boyfriend and I broke up recently. I'm so lost right now.": "sad", "when that happened to me i watched a lot of movies , for some reason the sad movies made me cry, but just be strong and patient one day you realize you can do better or find someone new": "sad", "I know, it's just so frustrating after spending so long building your lives together. ": "annoyed", "it happens to the best of us, and i totally understand where your coming from , spend some time with your friends or loved ones ": "lonely", "My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry. ": "surprised", "What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.": "surprised", "He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes. It's melt in your mouth good.": "disgusted", "That sounds so delicious I would have loved a plate of that food any deserts ": "surprised", "I got a promotion in work. I am so excited for the raise and added responsibility. ": "anticipating", "Congratulations! Sounds like you're ready for the new position.": "prepared", "Thank you, I am so excited. It has taken 3 years of hard work to earn this promotion.": "proud", "What is your work area?": "hopeful", "I work in the military ": "confident", "My daughter can say so many new words, love to see her thrive!": "proud", "That is so exciting! Such a fun time in life to watch them discover new things and always be such a surprise with what you didn't know that they already knew! ha ha, that's a tongue twister.": "surprised", "Yes, thank you! Having children is a wonderfull blessing. Couldn't imagine my life without my daughter. Do you have children?": "grateful", "I do!  An 8 year old daughter and 5 year old son.  They are my life as well so I totally get what you're saying.  How old is your daughter?": "sentimental", "I've got all of my bags packed, passport ready, and i'm not even leaving for vacation until next week.": "prepared", "Where are you going": "anticipating", "I'm going to Japan.

Did you get a spicy Tuna Roll?": "surprised", "I did indeed. Along with every other kind of roll that they had, haha.": "impressed", "Sounds good.  You have some generous parents.": "grateful", "So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!": "impressed", "Very nice, wind in your hair, exercise, and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?": "confident", "It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?": "nostalgic", "I am actually home bound, but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!": "sentimental", "It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.": "lonely", "I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when I'm watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that I'm loved by a lot of people.": "lonely", "That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!": "trusting", "You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support, no matter the miles between you.  Take care of yourself and get out with friends when you can!": "caring", "Whenever we moved abroad, I learned to trust my instinct and sense of adventure.": "trusting", "You sound like you're embracing life!": "content", "Ah -- thank you! Definitely aware of wanting to live life to its fullest. We've recently gone through a tough time, so it feels lovely to focus on adventure again.": "content", "Where did you move to?  I feel you. I am in the same place.  Just reversed 13 years of Lupus suffering by going plant based and now I want to live and see the world! I would love to move to Italy.": "hopeful", "Bless you! What a *relief* and how impressive! We've lived in Amsterdam, Hong Kong and Zurich -- Alaska may be next. (And Italy is awesome, by the way!)": "impressed", "It's my brother's 16th birthday in a couple days and he's probably getting a nicer car than I currently have. I'm 24.": "jealous", "Oh wow, I'd be really jealous of him.": "jealous", "I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.": "jealous", "Well, hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon.": "jealous", "So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore. Score!": "sentimental", "That is nice.": "grateful", "Yes indeed! I am very happy about it. Do you have any younger siblings?": "joyful", "I have one younger brother but he is old enough to drive on his own,": "impressed", "I saw somebody I hadn't in years. It was a nice meeting.": "surprised", "Its always nice to catch up": "surprised", "Yes it is. I am glad that I was able to speak with her.": "grateful", "I hope you keep doing thaty": "hopeful", "I love the adventure and perspective of living away from my home state -- but that doesn't mean I don't miss elements of it while I'm gone!": "lonely", "Same here. I actually moved to the other side of the USA, and I do miss my home": "lonely", "Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?": "lonely", "Not as often as I would like. Air travel is expensive after all. I know exactly what you mean though!": "content", "I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman. ": "faithful", "Were you happy about that, or creeped out?": "terrified", "I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.": "faithful", "You're a good guy. Did she take it well?": "trusting", "I recently attended a play. My friend's acting was significant!": "faithful", "That's really awesome that you supported your friend!": "surprised", "I am very glad that I went and supported him.": "grateful", "I'm sure he really appreciated you support too!": "caring", "Sometimes when I'm driving home after a holiday, such as christmas, I get an overwhelming sense of being alone.": "lonely", "Aw, I'm sorry. I know this isn't the best solution, but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?": "annoyed", "No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!": "apprehensive", "No problem! I know you can't always fix everything, but it's worth trying wierd ideas every now and then": "annoyed", "So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!": "surprised", "Oh wow, I love that kind of sauce": "impressed", "Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.": "ashamed", "That isnt long at all": "annoyed", "I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?": "confident", "It is always good to keep our skills up to date. We never know. It could also help for a promotion also.": "proud", "Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.": "hopeful", "I hope you get your promotion.": "hopeful", "I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!": "anticipating", "Oh man, your life is about to get so much more hectic. I feel for you. When my first was born, I was just as pumped, full of naivety and positivity. I felt like I could take on anything coming my way. I was exhausted after two weeks. It's such a long ride until they're able to even remotely look after themselves.": "excited", "I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.": "hopeful", "I know you have a lot of work ahead of you, but I'm sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life. As a man, I can't imagine what you'll have to go through, or what you will enjoy, but I really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child.": "hopeful", "So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.": "afraid", "Did it scare you?": "terrified", "Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?": "nostalgic", "Yes, a little bit. When I was young, I didn't like that much scary movies.": "afraid", "I'm ready for football season to start, NFL preseason started this week, and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!": "anticipating", "Whats your favorite team?": "excited", "In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama": "excited", "Well for me, in the NFL I like the Cowboys and college its Alabama too.": "excited", "I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike, it was insane!": "impressed", "That's pretty cool. I bet it's pretty difficult to do something like that.": "impressed", "I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV": "surprised", "I'd love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself, but I'm not sure if there's any locations near me.": "jealous", "My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.": "grateful", "Aw I am sorry that happened to you. I hope the repair didn't cost you too much! ": "furious", "It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.": "grateful", "Ah I see. Something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up, so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours. ": "annoyed", "I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!": "confident", "Well at least you put in the effort. What grade did you end up receiving on this test?": "confident", "I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.": "surprised", "That's great! Hard work pays off I guess.": "confident", "My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago, I'm still in shock.": "devastated", "Oh I'm sorry.  How are his family doing?": "sad", "They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.": "sad", "It's pretty hard to deal with.  One of my friend's buddies died in a car crash as well.": "sad", "I realized yesterday I was pregnant, I was in shock!": "surprised", "Woah, that is huge news. How are you handling the news.": "devastated", "I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.": "disappointed", "I am happy to hear that you will be ok. Enjoy having no kids while you can!": "joyful", "When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area, I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood. ": "prepared", "That does not sound fun. What did you do to prepare. ": "prepared", "I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.": "prepared", "That is very smart thinking!": "confident", "I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once, I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.": "guilty", "How old were you? If you were a kid, that deserves a pass!": "nostalgic", "I was 17, at that age I should of known better.": "ashamed", "You live and you learn, at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!": "terrified", "My friend has had the flu, and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.": "caring", "That's sweet of you, the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!": "caring", "Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny. ": "caring", "That's good, at least he is getting better, he'll survive!": "sad", "I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school, I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.": "proud", "There's nothing wrong with that": "afraid", "I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.": "proud", "You should celebrate too. I would": "proud", "The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.": "afraid", "That is always disappointing. Did you have a good time with your friends anyway?": "disappointed", "Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.": "nostalgic", "Sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what. You have good friends. ": "lonely", "I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.": "anxious", "I too feel the same. What did happen at last?": "terrified", "The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)": "anxious", "Yeah, very good to hear! congrats!": "confident", "The other day I had to take my dogs out before work, but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.": "caring", "Eww, I hate neighbors that have no class.": "disgusted", "She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.": "annoyed", "Maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.": "annoyed", "I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.": "embarrassed", "How awful! Please tell me you can laugh a little about it now?": "embarrassed", "Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.": "embarrassed", "Embarrassing things happen to all of us!": "embarrassed", "My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork. I've been trying to teach him for a couple of months!": "impressed", "Amazing!

Where did you guys go?": "confident", "Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P": "afraid", "That sounds like a fun day! My wife and i used to go to movies a lot!": "nostalgic", "Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning, he did not go easily :(": "sad", "That's terrible.  Was he already very sick?": "sad", "Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.": "sad", "Im sorry he went through that.": "sad", "I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail": "confident", "Those were the days right. I loved those paychecks no bills.... can we go back to that? ": "nostalgic", "Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one": "surprised", "Yeah and I bet it was like a whole 100 or 200 bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo.

Is that a dealbreaker": "hopeful", "Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is!

One day you'll be called grandma": "nostalgic", "The last time I went to the fair, I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!": "embarrassed", "that is embarassing, but were you at least okay?": "embarrassed", "I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay.

All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.": "surprised", "that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.": "excited", "I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer.

Make me worry a bit.": "trusting", "I understand, he will learn though once he gets a job and has to pay bills that he will want to go to sleep at a decent time!": "annoyed", "My wife usually sniffs out anything going on, but I was able to successfully plan a surprise party for her without her knowing.": "surprised", "Did you have a bunch of people show up there at the party?": "surprised", "Yes. Friends, family, cake, all of it. Even one friend from out of town she hasnt seen in years.": "surprised", "That's a great job! Well done!": "confident", "Thank you.

I couldn't be where I am without her": "caring", "You should take her on a vacation, or something. She deserves it.": "jealous", "I can handle, bees, scorpions, wasps, crickets, and spiders.  But for some reason I lose my mind around roaches.": "terrified", "At least you can handle those. I can't do any of those": "embarrassed", "I take some conselation in that, however my kids laugh when they hear thier dad scream like a girl at a flying roach.": "disgusted", "Well, they would probably be the same if they were in your shoes": "disgusted", "I feel guilty because I couldn't go to my friends party": "ashamed", "Understandable.  What was the reason?": "angry", "I was working and I couldn't leave early": "disappointed", "Did you explain it to them.  That's a pretty good reason to miss it.": "sad", "As a momma's boy I always missed my mom anytime she was gone for an extended period of time.": "sentimental", "Sure, that makes sense.": "confident", "Fortunately, she rarely was gone for long periods of time, but I always dreaded this once a year work training she had to do.": "guilty", "How's your relationship now ?": "faithful", "Oh it's great.": "confident", "I am so excited about going to the movies": "excited", "Oh cool!

I will do the same! thanks for sharing": "excited", "The other day I framed the puzzle we used as a guest book at our wedding.": "nostalgic", "What a great idea, where did that come from?": "surprised", "Etsy somewhere.  My wife bought it, so I don't really know which one, but you can find a bunch on there.": "jealous", "Well I need to keep that in mind, great suggestion ": "confident", "Well, what a trip that was. I just drove from Northern California to Florida. I just knew there would be no problems, and I was right.": "surprised", "Oh wow, what a long trip. How long did it take?": "surprised", "Six days in all, but I wasn't rushing it. I wanted to see a bit of the country. It was amazing actually.": "surprised", "That is a long time to be in the car for sure.": "grateful", "It's not so bad really. You get used to it. If you remember to stop and stretch now and again you're ok. And there are some decent rest areas, some with free coffee!": "content", "Oh well that's a plu!": "impressed", "Oh yes. Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!": "surprised", "So where did you stop along the way?": "annoyed", "I have big renovation plans for my house.

Have you ever been married?": "lonely", "I was engaged but my woman left me": "faithful", "I'm so sorry. It wasn't meant to be.": "sad", "I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.": "nostalgic", "That's such a good tune.": "content", "Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.": "nostalgic", "Yeah, it's definitely a classic. It reminds me of my childhood as well.": "nostalgic", "I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.": "ashamed", "Maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated, without showing anger.": "angry", "True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.": "surprised", "Yeah, just stay positive about it, I'm sure you'll figure something out.": "apprehensive", "K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.": "afraid", "Was it just a bad feeling you had?": "embarrassed", "It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.": "afraid", "Maybe someone died there": "sad", "Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.": "afraid", "I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.": "annoyed", "Oh yeah, the buffering?  Very annoying.": "annoyed", "Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.": "annoyed", "I hear that.  Sometimes the classics are impossible to find.": "disappointed", "My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.": "impressed", "Did you get her something special?": "surprised", "Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.": "caring", "Oh awesome, That is great!": "content", "I do hope she has a wonderful time. It's not easy living in a family with a disabled sibling and she just takes it all in her stride.": "caring", "I want to ask this girl I'm friends with out but I'm nervous to to so.": "apprehensive", "You wont know an answer if you dont ask": "apprehensive", "Problem is if she says no then it would make things weird between us.  I am afraid that either way I may not be able to see her again.": "afraid", "Just play it safe": "excited", "I really wanted to try bison meet and I went all the way to that whole foods store like 57 miles away and they didn't have it, what a waste of time": "disappointed", "That sucks, after going all that way too and you didn't even get to try it.

Be sure to let me know how it is!": "hopeful", "My rottweiler passes a lot of gas in the evenings.": "lonely", "That's funny.": "embarrassed", "Not so much.  It is such a thick scent and it follows you everywhere you go in the house.  I usually put him out when he starts it up.": "nostalgic", "Wonder if it has to do with his diet?": "disgusted", "It's been a long week! My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.": "annoyed", "Will he be back soon?": "trusting", "I sure hope so!

Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.": "lonely", "ha, that's too funny.": "embarrassed", "It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.": "lonely", "That sounds tough :-(  does he get back soon?": "annoyed", "In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!": "caring", "You must be so proud of him!": "proud", "My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.": "caring", "What was going on with her?": "surprised", "Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.": "anxious", "That sounds pretty serious, glad she is okay now!": "caring", "It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.": "caring", "I have this cat that loves to cause issues ": "caring", "What sort of issues?": "anxious", "Like last night.

The gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want'": "surprised", "A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would. ": "disgusted", "So you covered him. It was very noble from your side to act in this way": "caring", "It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker. ": "guilty", "Well, at least you did something good for that co-worker and most probably he feels indebted toward you": "jealous", "That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover. ": "disgusted", "My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.": "surprised", "So you have to wait a week longer to see her again? That stinks.": "anticipating", "Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.": "afraid", "Yeah, I can imagine. At least it's only one week!": "lonely", "It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.": "grateful", "Great to hear that.I hope you enjoy your new life.": "content", "After such a long time we certainly will.

": "surprised", "Oh my, did you have a good time?": "surprised", "I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.": "faithful", "I don't understand that either. It really makes you sick to think about. Have you experienced this?": "disgusted", "No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?": "afraid", "No I have not. I would never participate in that either. My wife and I are extremely happy together.": "faithful", "I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.": "afraid", "It always seems to work out like that doesn't it?": "annoyed", "It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.": "hopeful", "I may have to check that out as well.": "afraid", "A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.": "sentimental", "Yes, but they also bring about a lot of good changes as well.": "grateful", "Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.": "jealous", "Yes, the first years of a baby's life, the mother pretty much spends entirely with them. The husband is kind of left out in the cold.": "faithful", "My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!": "caring", "That is wonderful! Moms are truly a gift! I miss my Mom at times.

I actually broke up with a previous girlfriend over the same type of thing.": "guilty", "When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!": "surprised", "Oh that must have been so exciting and surprising! ": "proud", "It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!": "surprised", "Did you all do some fun things while he was there?": "surprised", "We certainly did.

I got everything on their lists!": "surprised", "Was it like black friday? lol": "surprised", "YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!": "annoyed", "Stick to your routine next time": "prepared", "I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!  ": "disappointed", "I hear ya! I am definitely shopping online": "excited", "Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!": "disgusted", "plus you can usually get some kind of cash back. I love deals": "hopeful", "The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider ": "terrified", "Ew, I hate spiders. We are in the process of getting them out of our garage.": "terrified", "I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that! ": "disgusted", "Oh no, throw it away!!!!": "embarrassed", "It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this \"play\" I went to recently was a little too much.": "apprehensive", "How was it too much?": "surprised", "Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat \"mystery candy\" from a box while blindfolded!": "surprised", "That sounds very strange": "lonely", "Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!": "hopeful", "How big is the bonus usually?": "joyful", "It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!": "annoyed", "Wow, well I hope you guys get it this year then!": "hopeful", "When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.": "grateful", "Why did you do that?": "guilty", "He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!": "surprised", "Wow, good for you guys!": "surprised", "Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.": "nostalgic", "How old were you?": "sentimental", "I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!": "embarrassed", "That is young, I wish someone had helped you!": "trusting", "I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.": "anxious", "Math has never been my strong suit. I'm more of a history type of person.": "confident", "Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!": "impressed", "That was very altruistic of her! ": "disgusted", "My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night ": "annoyed", "Why she is doing that?": "annoyed", "She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her! ": "annoyed", "Ah ok I undestand.": "embarrassed", "I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27, I would have thought you were crazy.": "surprised", "why did you go back?": "guilty", "I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it). I re-taught myself basic algebra, and was accepted to a state university two years ago! ": "proud", "good for you, best of luck!!": "confident", "i was so stressed when i found out that i did not get accepted in my dream college": "hopeful", "Oh no.

I would feel the same way.": "jealous", "i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years": "impressed", "What do you mean by that? I'm not a gamer really": "lonely", "gaming has blown up this past couple of years ": "surprised", "Oh you're right, it has. I hear about it more and more": "afraid", "I love roller coasters, but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter. ": "terrified", "I hate that most parks close during the winter too. Do you have any indoor type amusement parks near you?": "terrified", "Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.": "nostalgic", "I feel you. You will just have to go as often as possible during the other months to make up for the winter time without!": "lonely", "I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.": "confident", "Ooh, congratulations! I'll be graduating soon too. What's your major?": "anticipating", "I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?": "confident", "That's very cool. My dad's an electrical engineer, actually. I'm a cybersecurity major myself.": "jealous", "i really am thankful for everything that i have and had": "grateful", "What is your most prized posession?": "hopeful", "it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little": "sentimental", "Why is that?": "afraid", "he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional": "sentimental", "My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!": "impressed", "Oh wow, maybe he can get a scholarship! I know some colleges now offer bowling athletic programs.": "impressed", "Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well.

Do you have means of defending yourself?\\": "terrified", "No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!": "terrified", "Maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! Don't hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!": "terrified", "So I suck hard at bowling, but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.": "embarrassed", "Ha ha! I have done that, too. So embarrassing.": "embarrassed", "Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.": "embarrassed", "Phew, so they got most of the attention.": "jealous", "I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!": "guilty", "It can be hard in those situation I know you don't want to loose a friend in the end.": "apprehensive", "Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.": "guilty", "Yes you should but when you feel comfortable don't feel guilty you are the victim he is a sad case you got this.": "guilty", "I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.": "lonely", "Aw, that has to be tough not to see your friends. Do they visit often?": "lonely", "No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.": "lonely", "How awful! You're much better off staying at home. I hope you find new friends soon!": "lonely", "So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.": "anxious", "School can be tough.

It's very frustrating.": "annoyed", "Oh that's not good. Do they argue about small things?": "disappointed", "Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.": "annoyed", "Yikes, that shouldn't be. I think you've really stepped up in this situation. Hopefully they can see that and change their ways.": "disgusted", "I think storms are wonderful, except when the power goes out.": "afraid", "I love storms too but yeah, that's a nuisance.": "anticipating", "It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.": "terrified", "Yikes! Lightning didn't strike real close by, did it?": "annoyed", "O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.": "terrified", "College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!": "confident", "That is good. Will it be a difficult semester?": "confident", "It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!": "confident", "That is good. I am sometime a procrastinator.": "hopeful", "I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.": "nostalgic", "Awww, what fun.  That must have been so nostalgic for you!  I wish I was back in childhood again sometimes.": "nostalgic", "It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.": "nostalgic", "I saw a toy that they are bringing back from a couple decades ago when I was a kid and wow, it was so neat to see!": "nostalgic", "So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.": "impressed", "Wow. Sibling's got skills.": "impressed", "For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!": "impressed", "How long has he been bowling?": "impressed", "I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.": "anxious", "I am sorry to hear that, I am sure you will be fine. What kind of job is it?": "anxious", "it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.": "anticipating", "Well, it shouldn't be too bad. If you couldn't do the work I'm sure they wouldn't have hired you.": "ashamed", "So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.": "guilty", "That's a bummer. At least you will be more attentive next time?": "disappointed", "For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!": "annoyed", "Indeed. If everyone got worked up over things like that, we'd all be out of jobs.": "confident", "So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.": "nostalgic", "That sounds incredible. Did you visit the Great Salt Lake?": "impressed", "No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!": "surprised", "Man, I definitely have to go there. Sounds like a great place for sightseeing.": "impressed", "So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!": "jealous", "Oh my god, Do you think he got it just because you like it so much?": "surprised", "I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!": "surprised", "That is hilarious, In a cruel kind of way.": "embarrassed", "So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.": "apprehensive", "Ohh, I feel you. I felt the same way, when I was planning to buy a new car.": "lonely", "Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.": "apprehensive", "Yeah. I believe you are emotionally attached to it!": "sentimental", "PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!": "surprised", "Wow why would they even do that?": "disgusted", "It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.": "angry", "Sheesh, people will take anything that's not nailed down these days.": "annoyed", "So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!": "angry", "That's terrible to hear. Is it old?": "sad", "Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.": "nostalgic", "Are you thinking of getting a new car?": "jealous", "I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.": "anxious", "Me too. Its nerve wrecking": "anxious", "I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.": "afraid", "Maybe you should take some classes to help you with that": "guilty", "I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.": "disgusted", "Ohh, cleaning dog poop is always been annoying, yet petting the dog is always amusing.": "annoyed", "Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.": "disgusted", "Ha ha. I feel sorry for you though. No one likes to clean the dog poop!": "disgusted", "So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.": "embarrassed", "That has happened to me several times": "embarrassed", "Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.": "embarrassed", "Lol. They probably just laughed about it over dinner": "embarrassed", "I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester. ": "anxious", "Were you able to get them?": "surprised", "Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!": "grateful", "That was so sweet of him! You're lucky to have such a sweet boyfriend": "surprised", "i was really glad i finished my service for the military": "confident", "Thanks you for your service": "annoyed", "it is a pleasure i am really proud i did this for my country": "proud", "Which branch?": "terrified", "i did not expect my car to be soo good for the price i paid": "surprised", "I have never had that feeling.": "content", "yeah it was a used car i was not expecting much but it turned out really well": "surprised", "Well thats good.

Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!": "terrified", "Oh wow! That must have been terrifying! Were they able to help her?": "terrified", "Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.": "terrified", "I could imagine. It must have been amazing to see her rescued though!": "impressed", "So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.": "surprised", "That sucks. Did they give you any reason why they won't verify it?": "angry", "Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.": "disappointed", "Well, I hope they can get you taken care of soon. I know I hate it when I can't get to my money I have online.": "annoyed", "Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in, yet here I am awake early.": "annoyed", "I am the same.. woke up at 6 for no reason": "afraid", "It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.": "annoyed", "LOL i hate that": "annoyed", "I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.": "terrified", "I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.": "apprehensive", "I understand those kind of situation could scarry.": "terrified", "Last semester, I had to give a class presentation.

It was through a company so I couldn't really get much out of them.  Luckily a friend stepped up and watched them for me.": "surprised", "That's ridiculous.

I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it, or harm my familY!": "devastated", "I'm glad you were safe. Tornados are not a fun thing to experience.": "afraid", "No, they are so awful! They can destroy so much.": "furious", "Have you only had to deal with one?": "jealous", "My husband took me to get a new wedding band recently": "surprised", "Well, that's very nice. I'm sure you were looking forward to that shopping trip.": "excited", "I didn't know ahead of time! Mine had broken a bit and he saved up to get me a new one.": "surprised", "That's was so thoughtful and sweet! Seems like you are a lucky wife!": "grateful", "I love the holidays. Driving around looking at decoration is my favorite.": "nostalgic", "That is a lot of fun.  What is your favorite holiday to drive around in?": "content", "Christmas. It makes me miss my moms decor.": "lonely", "Im sorry it makes you miss your moms decor.  At least you have those memories to hang onto.": "sad", "I have a wonderful sister-in-law.  who is always there for me when I need her": "faithful", "That must be comforting!  It is good to have people in your life that are supportive.": "grateful", "I feel so lucky to have her as a sister-in-law and a friend.  She is always there to offer a supporting ear and encouraging word.": "impressed", "Don't ever take her for granted!  Make sure she knows you are thankful!": "surprised", "A few weeks ago, we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But, it rained several days, so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted, which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.": "disappointed", "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you not live close to a beach?": "sad", "Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now. So, a long time since we first went.": "nostalgic", "That must suck not living close to a beach. Hopefully you get to go back real soon.": "disappointed", "My husband just a promotion at work he was really wanting": "jealous", "Hah, seems we both had some luck. Good for him!": "surprised", "I know..ha ha!  He worked so hard for this and I am so proud of him.": "proud", "You guys should go out and celebrate! ": "proud", "We took a vacation recently and had to leave my daughter's teenage boyfriend a key to our house so he could take care of the pets. He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.": "trusting", "Lucky! I would not trust anyone in my house!": "trusting", "We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!": "sad", "I am happy for you! ": "joyful", "My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell": "trusting", "Oh no! That's my greatest fear that people will tell my secrets": "trusting", "I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things": "trusting", "Aw, perhaps she just slipped up? It does happen even to the best of us": "ashamed", "One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!": "afraid", "Oh that can be scary. I don't watch horror movies because I know that I'll do just that!": "terrified", "It was so scary! Luckily, it was actually my shadow! The light made my shadow show up, but it first appeared to be an intruder!": "afraid", "Well I'm glad you were ok! Sometimes it's not just a shadow": "terrified", "Last weekend, my family and I enjoyed a nice meal together, and then watched a movie. It was a relaxing time at home, just enjoying each other's company.": "content", "That's the best kind of day.": "content", "Yes, it was drama free and a relaxing time.": "content", "Must have been so nice, what movie did you watch?": "surprised", "My dog, riley had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure": "sad", "I am so sorry to hear about Riley, I know he was an important part of the family. How is everyone holding up after the news?": "sad", "It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps": "sad", "Yes that is true. You know there is peace in another place. He will always be remembered.": "sad", "I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me. She was in a bad spot and needed him for financial support, and that's why I didn't tell her. But, I still felt so bad about it.": "guilty", "I can empathize with you there.  Do you think there might be another way to let her know? ": "sad", "Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him. I thought it would just make things worse for her.": "caring", "Well money is not everything, one day it will come out and then the timing will likely be worse.": "apprehensive", "I am trying a new diet to treat my Lupus.  ": "ashamed", "Really!  Good for you!  Are you excited to start or nervous?": "anticipating", "I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take": "apprehensive", "It's OK to be nervous, but don't let it stop you!  No risk, no reward!": "apprehensive", "There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments, so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating, since it causes others more work.": "annoyed", "That sucks, I work with people like that and it's just more work for other people": "annoyed", "Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!": "surprised", "That's horrible, you should tell the boss and get her fired": "furious", "My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning, and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.": "sad", "I bet it was.  Death is never an easy thing to deal with, especially for a child.": "surprised", "Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!": "sad", "I hope she will be alright!  I remember how devastated I was when my last dog passed away and I was an adult.  A kids emotions seem to amplify everything! ": "sad", "I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.": "surprised", "You are lucky!": "surprised", "Not normally, so I was quite surprised. ": "surprised", "how much did you win?": "confident", "$1000. It was enough to help me catch up on my bills. So I was happy.": "surprised", "I have never won that much. Congratulations": "surprised", "Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out. ": "nostalgic", "I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day. ": "embarrassed", "Oh no! What happened?": "embarrassed", "Someone backed into my new car.": "furious", "Oh geez, thats terrible!  Did they run from the scene?  Hopefully they left some information.  I was in a hit and run about 4 months after I bought my new car and I felt sick that it was already hit.": "furious", "Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it. ": "furious", "Many years ago, we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her, but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!": "caring", "Wow. Do think he had bad intentions?": "trusting", "Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol": "impressed", "I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.": "angry", "Oh man...I hate checking the mail..it could be something crappy": "annoyed", "Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night. ": "furious", "Oh god- Do you live in the country?": "afraid", "Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.": "content", "Then the person might be caught, do you have a camera? That is really crappy of someone! I have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this": "furious", "That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.": "angry", "It's a good idea to have one just in case. Murders, robberies etc happen even in small/nice towns. Just for your safety ": "afraid", "My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!": "surprised", "That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?": "nostalgic", "Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!": "surprised", "That is a shame.

Is that you? ha ha.": "annoyed", "Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!": "afraid", "Ha ha, guess you weren't the one.  That would've been crazy!  I hope its okay!  I'm sure someone will try to grab it.": "afraid", "I got some bad news today, my dad passed away.": "sad", "oh my goodness thats terrible, i am so sorry!": "devastated", "Thank you, I am a mess.

Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever.

I am sorry for your loss!": "devastated", "Thank you, she was 12 years old so I knew it was coming but still shook up about it.": "devastated", "Yes, we can never be truly ready to lose our babies like that.

Was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be?": "proud", "Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special! ": "faithful", "Sounds like it was a once in a lifetime experience.": "trusting", "I think it was :)": "nostalgic", "I like going fishing, it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.": "nostalgic", "Do you have any kids?": "grateful", "I do, I have a 6 month old boy.

Everybody was staring at me.": "embarrassed", "Was it at college?": "proud", "No, it was at work.": "annoyed", "OH wow! Did you get it all over youself?": "surprised", "I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it! ": "embarrassed", "That sounds like a really stressful situation. It's really good to know that there are still helpful people out there!": "grateful", "Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!": "terrified", "I'm glad you've put a positive spin on it :) ": "hopeful", "I'm ready for college football to start.

I'm sure the employees see that kind of thing all the time, though.": "annoyed", "I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.": "surprised", "Oh that's super excited! I'm sure you're really proud of him.": "proud", "Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!": "impressed", "That's super great to hear! Well deserved.": "confident", "I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!": "trusting", "What a nice guy.  There are fewer and fewer of those every day.": "jealous", "It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier.

Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!": "sad", "I hope you get better soon!": "hopeful", "My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.": "annoyed", "That's never fun!  Large unexpected expenses are the worst": "surprised", "Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.": "angry", "Oh no! At least you have something to look forward to, the new house!": "embarrassed", "I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.": "angry", "Oh no! What a terrible thing to have happen! Were you able to confront them?": "furious", "No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.": "annoyed", "That is just awful. Now you'll have to pay to have it repaired. ": "furious", "Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!": "excited", "Nice. Did you like it?": "surprised", "I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary ": "confident", "Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech, and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!": "surprised", "It was who,who were them?": "surprised", "I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).": "surprised", "Ok,thats amusing": "embarrassed", "So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!": "nostalgic", "Wow! thats great! I bet you feel proud of it!": "proud", "Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.": "impressed", "I bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday! ": "joyful", "So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!": "disgusted", "Oh no! Were you gone for long?": "embarrassed", "We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess": "lonely", "What a bad doggie... hopefully they don't do it again": "sad", "I am starting a new phase in my life.

I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress": "hopeful", "You will be fine! Stay optimistic about it": "hopeful", "I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things": "hopeful", "I agree, but having great joy in life helps": "content", "I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.": "confident", "It's good you're motivated! That's a step in the right direction": "confident", "Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.": "annoyed", "I agree. I wish I could go back to school and pay more attention": "jealous", "My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck": "jealous", "That's amazing and a very quick profit!  I'm a little bit jealous myself.  ": "jealous", "Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!": "nostalgic", "It's amazing the effect something so seemingly small, like the company headquarters opening, can effect an entire town like that": "excited", "So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.": "content", "Yikes.  Did you get injured?": "terrified", "No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.": "impressed", "Yeah and the lanes are really slick.  That's pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.": "embarrassed", "My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.": "jealous", "I would be too! That's a really nice car for his first car!": "jealous", "No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!": "proud", "I do too. Maybe he will left you drive it!": "annoyed", "I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!": "surprised", "Wow you must be so happy! Nothing like a new car": "impressed", "I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.": "grateful", "HAving a reliable car really changes things for the best": "grateful", "I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.": "nostalgic", "Nice! What genre of playlist was it? ": "impressed", "It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.": "excited", "Cool! I like to rediscover old playlists I made when I was younger.": "nostalgic", "My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.": "anxious", "I can only imagine! How is he now?": "sad", "They still have more tests to do.

I bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new.": "confident", "I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!": "excited", "It is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own": "excited", "Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)": "excited", "I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!": "embarrassed", "oh , how he reacted next": "surprised", "It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.": "ashamed", "its ok it happens with every one": "embarrassed", "We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.": "excited", "Yes, that will be awesome! How long has it been since you've seen everyone?": "excited", "It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.": "excited", "That's fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up.": "impressed", "I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.": "confident", "That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal.": "proud", "Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.": "confident", "It's really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it.": "jealous", "I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.": "hopeful", "That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?": "confident", "I have but I've never really stuck to it.

Don't forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!": "ashamed", "My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.": "impressed", "Sounds impressive, does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?": "impressed", "He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.": "impressed", "Very nice, I would be proud too.": "proud", "Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!": "annoyed", "oh no what happened?": "embarrassed", "Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)": "disgusted", "that would really help if it was a permanent solution": "annoyed", "Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.": "guilty", "yeah enough is enough. i totally can't say i blame you.": "apprehensive", "Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.": "nostalgic", "bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep.": "annoyed", "I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.": "afraid", "I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid.": "afraid", "No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.": "surprised", "That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on.": "afraid", "I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!": "excited", "That will be an amazing trip!!": "excited", "I know!

I felt I did really well.": "confident", "That is great! It's so awesome to feel confident after an interview!": "confident", "Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.": "sad", "Yes it sure is. Did you end up getting the job?": "confident", "Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!": "terrified", "Was it a ghost?": "terrified", "I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!": "terrified", "Oh,that was so hillarious": "surprised", "It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my \"attacker\" off with!": "embarrassed", "I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself": "proud", "That's great, keep it up if you can!": "grateful", "I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor.

": "annoyed", "I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone": "lonely", "It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe.": "terrified", "I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!": "anticipating", "Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!": "anticipating", "Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!": "annoyed", "OH that will be such a huge relief I'm sure!  It's crazy that people behave that way, knowing they are causing other people such strife.": "terrified", "They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.": "annoyed", "Someone stole my identity.": "furious", "Oh no! How did that happen and how much damage did they do?": "furious", "I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.": "furious", "That is horrible! What will you do?": "furious", "i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful": "grateful", "That is truly all you can ask for.": "angry", "yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted": "grateful", "I try to never take anything in life for granted. ": "grateful", "so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets": "prepared", "Wow, impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more? ": "impressed", "thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies": "caring", "You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.": "anticipating", "I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!": "joyful", "I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?": "faithful", "Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.": "surprised", "I can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! I'm glad you were able to visit him!": "surprised", "Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!": "joyful", "When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.": "sentimental", "Aww. It's the things money can't buy that bring us the greatest joy, no?": "sad", "Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.": "grateful", "That is so true and it's a good perspective to have.": "lonely", "My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses!

I guess just because summer is coming to an end?": "nostalgic", "the summer is horrid. heat, sweat, mosquitos, rain, and crowds everywhere": "annoyed", "I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it": "ashamed", "I do the same! I think everyone does.": "nostalgic", "yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad": "ashamed", "I think it's a normal human activity. You don't need to feel bad": "guilty", "I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.": "prepared", "That's the way to do it!  Be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!": "prepared", "I will try!

Keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers.": "furious", "My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.": "sentimental", "I can imagine. How old will they be?": "sad", "She will be 30.

": "impressed", "I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I": "content", "Now that you what? Tell me!": "afraid", "Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!": "embarrassed", "Oh that is great! I've heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!": "proud", "I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.": "content", "That's great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It's a restaurant and a store?": "surprised", "Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!": "caring", "Dragon tongue beans! I've never heard of them! What do they look like?": "surprised", "They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.": "surprised", "I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live, but this is new to me. ": "hopeful", "What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!": "excited", "It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?": "anticipating", "I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!": "terrified", "How did he scare you?": "terrified", "Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!": "surprised", "I bet that gave you a good scare! Gotta love dads and step dads!": "terrified", "My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.": "impressed", "Oh that sounds disgusting! ": "disgusted", "Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.": "disgusted", "I hope he gets that taken care of!": "caring", "When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.": "devastated", "I think we never really know what is going on inside people's mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life, but in reality, they are suffering.": "hopeful", "It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!": "afraid", "I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.": "disgusted", "Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.": "caring", "All around, it would be a good decision for society. Just last night, I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed, he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.": "disgusted", "There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.": "disgusted", "I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away": "sad", "Oh no. I'm so sorry. Can you video chat with her?": "sad", "Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!": "nostalgic", "How wonderful. That's what's important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.": "content", "I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!": "impressed", "Wow! That is insane, too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds.": "angry", "Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!": "impressed", "That sounds like a great time, one of those nights you always remember!": "nostalgic", "I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.": "confident", "Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think it's good because they get a variety.": "impressed", "That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.": "nostalgic", "Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!": "nostalgic", "That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.": "nostalgic", "When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.": "surprised", "I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.": "prepared", "It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!": "confident", "Yes, you are correct. You can always \"hope\" for the best, but also \"plan\" for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling.": "confident", "I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.": "apprehensive", "i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please": "proud", "That's wonderful, they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages.": "surprised", "he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian": "impressed", "Wow! That's impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop.": "impressed", "A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.": "annoyed", "Did you think about moving after that?": "afraid", "Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.": "prepared", "haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?": "embarrassed", "No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.": "lonely", "I found a cat in my attic yesterday!": "sentimental", "Oh wow! I hope that it was ok!": "afraid", "My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!": "terrified", "Oh no. That sounds really stressful!": "afraid", "My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.": "sentimental", "That is very unusual. She should be proud of herself.": "proud", "Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!": "proud", "Wow, I wish more would follow her example. That's a recovery.": "caring", "She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!": "caring", "I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!": "impressed", "I haven't watched actual TV in sooo long. What do you watch on Hulu?": "content", "I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!": "impressed", "That's real neat, I might check it out. I've only ever used Netflix, but Netflix is pretty good too.": "content", "My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident, I'm so upset.": "sad", "Aw, I bet he feels horrible about it.  Poor kitty!": "sad", "Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.": "caring", "Aw, that's always sad, I lost a cat once and I assume that's what happened to her ;(": "sad", "I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.": "devastated", "That would be horrific.  Do you know someone that this happened to?": "terrified", "Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.": "devastated", "That is just horrible.  I think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd.": "annoyed", "My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..": "surprised", "That is nice of your friend. I hope you enjoyed it.": "caring", "I did! It was a very nice gesture.": "surprised", "You can return the favor one day. That is what friends are for!": "lonely", "We are waiting on military orders right now, I'm so hoping they come through next week.": "hopeful", "Do you have any idea where you will go? Is it accompanied?": "anxious", "Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.": "surprised", "Well I hope they get there soon so you don't have to wait longer.": "anticipating", "I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.": "annoyed", "I'm with you on this one.  What is up with people these days, I just don't understand how they could do that.": "annoyed", "Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.": "annoyed", "I think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that, for instance more jail time.": "annoyed", "For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.": "nostalgic", "i had a similar experience, i miss it too": "nostalgic", "It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!": "nostalgic", "i totally agree": "jealous", "It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in! ": "confident", "Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.": "surprised", "I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out, it runs us about $65.  So we do it very rarely, it wastes a lot of money.": "annoyed", "Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries. ": "annoyed", "A week!?  That is just crazy, and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire.": "angry", "We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.": "prepared", "Where to?": "anticipating", "Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change. ": "content", "I spent some time there, when I was learning how to be an Army Medic. I really enjoyed my time there!": "nostalgic", "Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.": "content", "I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.": "prepared", "It's better to be safe than sorry. You can't overprepare.": "sad", "So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.": "disappointed", "I am glad you didn't get hit. I know how stressful hurricanes can be.": "prepared", "My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!": "surprised", "I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!": "surprised", "Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!": "grateful", "You are very lucky!": "grateful", "Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.": "grateful", "My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards ": "anxious", "That's strange, I hope she makes it out ok this time though.": "sad", "She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess": "caring", "Oh wow, I would never consider something like that hurting a dog.": "sad", "Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us": "sad", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she passed peacefully.": "sad", "Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.": "sad", "I am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing. She must have felt loved.": "caring", "We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.": "prepared", "That was a really smart call on your part! Were you worried?": "apprehensive", "I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.": "trusting", "Well, it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies.": "prepared", "I've been so busy packing, packing and more packing. ": "prepared", "That sounds pretty stressful. Are you moving soon?": "afraid", "Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.": "anxious", "That makes sense. I hate leaving things for the last second as well. Hopefully you won't have to leave everything boxed up for too long.": "disappointed", "I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.": "faithful", "That is great! You are lucky!": "grateful", "I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.": "caring", "It is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with.": "grateful", "I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.": "impressed", "Nice! Which ones did you hear!": "joyful", "Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back": "nostalgic", "That one is a zinger! I remember listening to that when I took my grandma to prom!": "nostalgic", "I took a test for college the other day, it was basically our midterm.": "prepared", "I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.": "confident", "Im sure you did fine. what was the subject?": "confident", "Discrete mathematics ": "proud", "I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago.

I grew up near Richmond!": "anticipating", "Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life": "embarrassed", "Nothing wrong with that.

I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P": "surprised", "Ha, yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home... other wise there's going to be a price to pay.": "annoyed", "Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.": "annoyed", "It always is, plus it gives you some brownie points as well.": "content", "i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public": "embarrassed", "I am sorry to hear that, my wife has done the same thing.

Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!": "embarrassed", "That's really common actually. There's a big exodus from there.  They voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high.": "surprised", "The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas.

I do hope she's feeling better. What was wrong with her, if you don't mind my asking?": "ashamed", "Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.": "disgusted", "Well, I'm really glad to hear she's recovered.

No time for anything fun.": "annoyed", "My mom is having weight loss surgery next week, I'm nervous.": "anxious", "What kind of operation is it? I'm unfamiliar with weight loss surgery.

She wont listen to me!": "caring", "Well, everyone is entitled to their own life choices. I'm sure she'll be alright.": "faithful", "there is nothing i hate more than losing in something": "annoyed", "Yeah, that's never fun.

I still feel pretty introverted, but since coming to college, I've been forced to socialize more, and it's help me at least \"fake it until I make it.\" I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time, but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?": "lonely", "that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice.

Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.": "lonely", "That sounds like a nice time!": "content", "It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!": "impressed", "Wow that worked out perfectly": "impressed", "I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud, and I had a hard time focusing": "annoyed", "Did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?": "disappointed", "No, I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible": "anxious", "Well, I hope you have some really good earphones - or that they quiet down - it's a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud.": "embarrassed", "I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!": "annoyed", "I know what you mean. Once I had a bank where the teller's literally had butts for heads.

I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!": "angry", "Well it was an upgrade from the bank I had where the tellers were actually robots.

As we were leaving, she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.": "embarrassed", "Oh no, the poor girl. Was she able to walk afterwards?": "ashamed", "Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere.

You guys can do something outdoors next time, right?": "jealous", "My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking, but ultimately underwhelming thing": "surprised", "hahaha why was it underwhelming?": "disgusted", "I guess because furry things don't really scare me, I was like well that was a waste of a reaction": "terrified", "lol how do you feel about spiders?": "terrified", "I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift": "furious", "Why were you getting mad?  Were you not lifting as much as you wanted?": "angry", "No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within": "afraid", "I see,  I do that too sometimes.  It helps with motivation": "confident", "There's too many things to think about": "hopeful", "You are good at generalizing aren't you?": "content", "Yeah, what am I getting myself into": "lonely", "I have no clue.. really I don't!": "angry", "I just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets.": "excited", "Close to $20,000, I think I'm going to spend it on traveling.": "grateful", "Thats sounds like a fun trip or 8": "excited", "I went to a play recently that was unconventional in a really fun way.

I wish i could just rewind time and go back": "nostalgic", "The micro brewery explosion in America has been awesome for my girlfriend and I, as we love craft beer. Until recently, our town didn't have one though.": "surprised", "I love beer! I wish I could try your guy's beer.  Is it a hard process?": "hopeful", "We actually don't brew our own, and hadn't been able to try many because we live in a small town. But we just got the news that a micro brewery was opening here in a few weeks!": "surprised", "Awesome, that's great news!  Hope you guys make a great tasting one and become big!": "surprised", "I hate it when other guys look at my girl": "jealous", "ooh, you should not be, she should be appreciated for looking good": "hopeful", "She's for my eyes only. At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!": "jealous", "aha, thats funny though": "embarrassed", "Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read \"Kitchen Confidential\", or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.": "devastated", "Oh, I haven't read it, but I was also sad to hear he passed": "sad", "He started from the bottom and worked his way up.

I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.": "surprised", "Sometimes we affect people that we don't realize.": "annoyed", "Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!": "caring", "Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday, so I had to work overtime, but I didn't even get paid for it!": "angry", "That doesn't seem fair. How are they getting around not paying you for it?": "jealous", "I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating.

It was pretty stressful.": "hopeful", "My brother just graduated and is on the job hunt, and he's described his experience as the same thing.. Seems like he has good interviews and they're receptive to him, but they don't really respond or give him an answer. Sorry to hear you guys go through that. Can't imagine how frustrating it is": "annoyed", "Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.": "annoyed", "Good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic. Maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job. I hope it's been good so far.": "hopeful", "A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.": "trusting", "That sounds like so much fun!": "excited", "I know - I wish I could do that.

It was all full of bugs! ": "disgusted", "I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me, that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot, so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!": "surprised", "On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.": "caring", "Yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results.

I hate it when a place doesn't live up to the hype.": "annoyed", "In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.": "embarrassed", "That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations": "lonely", "If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.": "disappointed", "If it gets to be too much be sure to walk away.": "afraid", "I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol.

It gets better but still hurts sometime.": "sad", "A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer, but he got a job and had to cancel.": "disappointed", "Aw, that sucks. But at least he got a job, right?": "jealous", "Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.": "impressed", "Well, hopefully he can schedule another time to come visit you.": "sad", "I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.": "content", "My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.  ": "sad", "Oh my. That is very unfortunate.": "sad", "Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.": "annoyed", "I know that feeling. Im sure she is looking down on you all.": "sad", "My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her. ": "sad", "That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats, is because they're so independent, and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.": "terrified", "I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad": "sad", "Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it.

I really want to play again.": "nostalgic", "My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport, albeit a little expensive. I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming, and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day.": "impressed", "It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!": "content", "Well, often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself, at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens, motivation starts to become real easy to get.": "jealous", "Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.": "surprised", "Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!": "afraid", "I've never been skydiving myself. I hear that it's a great experience, but I'm not sure if I have the bravery for it.": "apprehensive", "I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.": "trusting", "Oh wow. Is it something that you would do again?": "disgusted", "I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.": "confident", "I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!": "anticipating", "Sounds like fund, you must be excited!": "anticipating", "I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies.

I am sure you will have a great time.": "hopeful", "I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies. ": "anticipating", "I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face! ": "annoyed", "That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.": "terrified", "I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled! ": "terrified", "How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.": "afraid", "I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything": "anxious", "Well, it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?": "anxious", "a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money": "hopeful", "I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck": "confident", "I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.": "nostalgic", "Did you tell anyone about the dream?": "embarrassed", "I told my husband.

I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day. ": "annoyed", "sounds like a wonderful day!": "content", "It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back. ": "nostalgic", "I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.": "surprised", "Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway. ": "anticipating", "I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.": "disappointed", "Well thats unfortunate. Hopefully you will be able to buy it soon. ": "disappointed", "I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.": "hopeful", "I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!": "ashamed", "It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.": "surprised", "It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.": "terrified", "Well you have to live a little every now and then. I'm sure it was worth it, haha.": "nostalgic", "It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!": "surprised", "my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever": "annoyed", "Oh no, poor baby": "guilty", "i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow": "sad", "Yes cuddles will help": "caring", "i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions": "surprised", "That sounds really fun.

I've been watching it since I was a kid.": "excited", "I'm fascinated by how people can watch golf, I always found it really boring, but if you enjoy it then great!": "impressed", "I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!": "nostalgic", "Oh that totally changes things I guess, makes sense.": "jealous", "I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.": "excited", "Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.": "caring", "Aw that's terrible, at least you were able to comfort her?": "sad", "Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh.

Those people deserved some confrontation for sure.": "embarrassed", "Yes, they did.": "surprised", "I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it!

What revolting individuals!": "furious", "Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures. ": "disgusted", "They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!": "disgusted", "Really!! I would go even further and give them the electric chair. I have no tolerance for those types of people.

It really scared my wife and I. ": "terrified", "Oh, I hate it when that happens. Did you find out what it was?": "embarrassed", "It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in. ": "terrified", "I'm glad it wasn't something dangerous. That would be a terrifying experience.": "terrified", "It would be, I worry for the safety of my family. ": "trusting", "My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.": "trusting", "You do? thats good, friends can be terrible people to lend too.": "trusting", "They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.": "grateful", "I bet he pays you in full.": "proud", "Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.": "disappointed", "My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first ": "terrified", "I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?": "surprised", "He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too! ": "annoyed", "Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband. ": "grateful", "Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.": "afraid", "Does it look like a space ship?": "annoyed", "Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?": "afraid", "I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time": "afraid", "i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes": "jealous", "What does she do?": "proud", "like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat": "annoyed", "Wow, I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying": "annoyed", "It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.": "sad", "Aw I understand that, I have gone through that myself and it's very hard. When did this happen? ": "sad", "Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.": "proud", "Oh no I'm very sorry. What kind of pet? ": "sad", "A border collie, he was a great doggie.": "sad", "My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.": "apprehensive", "Oh no, have you been able to calm yourself down?": "embarrassed", "She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.": "trusting", "I can understand that, I think I would be a mess too.": "disgusted", "I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.": "disgusted", "That does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.": "annoyed", "I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.": "furious", "Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?": "embarrassed", "I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.": "prepared", "I bet you are, that's some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter?": "surprised", "I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.": "prepared", "How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency, and then to actually get to use it? I'm pretty jealous, and proud in a vicarious kind of way.": "confident", "I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!": "joyful", "I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.": "proud", "Well good luck with that!": "confident", "Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.": "devastated", "What are you studying?": "prepared", "Criminal and social justice.": "lonely", "I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.": "terrified", "Do roller coasters scare you": "terrified", "I think it was just the thought of being so high up.": "nostalgic", "I used to be afriad of heights too": "excited", "I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.": "annoyed", "That's a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.": "lonely", "Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.": "lonely", "Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.": "anxious", "In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.": "sad", "Goodness, you're right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you.": "annoyed", "Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.": "devastated", "I'm so very sorry for your loss, I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier.": "sad", "Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.": "lonely", "A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.": "surprised", "It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way, unfortunately.": "annoyed", "Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!": "surprised", "That's great! I'm glad you had a good time. I've never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!": "excited", "When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped. ": "trusting", "And how is she doing now": "proud", "She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade": "proud", "That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need": "content", "I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.": "content", "aww that's too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!": "disgusted", "I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.": "hopeful", "bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!": "disappointed", "I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious": "terrified", "Oh that sounds fun!": "excited", "Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.": "embarrassed", "That isn't good at all, glad you didn't have an accident. ": "embarrassed", "I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes": "furious", "Did you find any good companies.": "surprised", "a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is": "furious", "Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.": "furious", "I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!": "ashamed", "It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!": "ashamed", "Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house. ": "content", "I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it, just try better tomorrow.": "anxious", "The other night I had a panic attack out the blue ": "terrified", "That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?": "afraid", "Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about. ": "ashamed", "Are you able to do anything to prevent them?": "disgusted", "I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.": "embarrassed", "I'm sure that he will turn up soon. I really hope that you find him.": "sad", "We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.": "trusting", "Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them. ": "annoyed", "We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there. ": "hopeful", "I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.": "disgusted", "Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?": "ashamed", "That's just it. We didn't really \"break up\" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.": "sentimental", "That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.": "annoyed", "Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.": "grateful", "How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward, as the saying goes.": "surprised", "I will, you never know when someone else is in need! ": "lonely", "Kindness is infectious.": "hopeful", "It is, I have been so blessed in my life! ": "grateful", "My husband started college this week!": "proud", "How exciting, is he a non-traditional student?": "proud", "Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!": "proud", "That is really good, speaking from experience, all military men and women should get a degree.": "confident", "I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.": "sad", "Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning.": "disgusted", "No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.": "disgusted", "Oh gosh, that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right, and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!": "disgusted", "So gross, that is certain.": "disgusted", "I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air": "embarrassed", "Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.": "embarrassed", "I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards ": "embarrassed", "Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing, coffee on light colors stinks!": "afraid", "Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.": "afraid", "I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.": "afraid", "Oh man! I would have been so scared! ": "afraid", "I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.": "disappointed", "My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!": "annoyed", "Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at?": "annoyed", "People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying! ": "annoyed", "Yeah, that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs.": "annoyed", "I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.": "ashamed", "I do that all the time, no big deal.": "annoyed", "I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.": "joyful", "What kind of pizza did you eat?": "proud", "When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!": "confident", "That is such a relief, it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank. ": "grateful", "Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.": "confident", "Oh yeah, retirement will come before you know it, it is good to be prepared! ": "prepared", "Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!": "hopeful", "Oh wow, now that really is exciting, congratulations! Did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?": "confident", "I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous. ": "confident", "Teaching little humans will be such a joy. I really hope you enjoy it!": "excited", "It really is, you are molding their future! ": "disgusted", "I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce": "sad", "That sucks, will she not let you see the dog at all?": "sad", "No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.": "furious", "Yes, that is probably a positive.": "hopeful", "Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.": "sad", "Yeah it really does. It's even worse to try and close those accounts!": "sad", "They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.": "furious", "Man that sounds really stressful...": "hopeful", "It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.": "disappointed", "My sister got a promotion at work last week!": "jealous", "oh that is awesome. what does she do?": "impressed", "She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)": "impressed", "that is great. my sister is an account too. she's also the office manager.": "impressed", "My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.": "impressed", "Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.": "proud", "Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.": "ashamed", "I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues. You sound like a good friend!": "proud", "My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!": "anxious", "don't be. i'm sure you raised him right. he will be starting his new adventure": "surprised", "I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.": "jealous", "i'm sure he's cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck. it will be fine.": "hopeful", "Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?": "disappointed", "it will be find. have a little fiath in him and you will see": "terrified", "Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!  ": "anticipating", "it's very exciting. i wish you both all the best.": "anticipating", "I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.": "nostalgic", "I remember that console, that's old school.": "nostalgic", "It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.": "content", "Those were the good old days!": "nostalgic", "I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.": "content", "are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?": "confident", "I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.": "disappointed", "thats good.. well you are on your way up!": "content", "Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.": "jealous", "I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made! ": "surprised", "Thats awesome, can we trade?": "surprised", "Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.": "annoyed", "That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready, unlike mine": "surprised", "Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!": "annoyed", "that is very true": "grateful", "Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.": "embarrassed", "hopefully its better tomorrow!": "anxious", "4": "hopeful", "Hmm, that's interesting tell me more about what that number means to you.": "nostalgic", "Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.": "caring", "Really, my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five, scared the poop out of me": "disgusted", "My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.": "annoyed", "I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday": "content", "Are you really able to work from home? Finding a gig is so difficult, I'm glad that it is working for you.": "grateful", "Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic": "disgusted", "I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am": "joyful", "That is fantastic. Any good new lately?": "content", "Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life! ": "content", "That is an amazing feeling. ": "grateful", "I had such a bad cold last week, I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.": "disgusted", "did you go to the doctor": "anxious", "No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.": "embarrassed", "yuk for sure": "disgusted", "No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!": "ashamed", "Well, did you eat her ice cream?": "guilty", "I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.": "guilty", "I wonder who actually ate it then.": "disgusted", "She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.": "annoyed", "So are you saying it could be the guy?": "jealous", "Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!": "guilty", "I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.": "hopeful", "You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.": "disappointed", "I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.": "hopeful", "Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers. ": "excited", "I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome": "disgusted", "That would be pretty cool to see, but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they're annoyed or angry! It didn't attack you, did it?": "furious", "I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing": "furious", "Ahh, okay. Yeah I don't know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it's turf. But still, that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!": "terrified", "I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!": "anxious", "Nice, I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasn't prepared, but there's only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever": "confident", "That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.": "confident", "Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal": "confident", "I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.": "sentimental", "i bet it does bud, I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it": "hopeful", "Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?": "sad", "yes i know, good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life.": "sentimental", "Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.": "afraid", "sometimes they cant avoid it ": "annoyed", "I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!": "embarrassed", "I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.": "surprised", "I cant imagine how scared you must have been.": "afraid", "Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.": "furious", "Not sure. You must be very confused. Did you crash?": "terrified", "2": "hopeful", "I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!": "afraid", "Oh god. Was it big?": "embarrassed", "Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.": "terrified", "Well, maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it.": "disappointed", "I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.": "jealous", "what does she draw": "annoyed", "Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.": "sentimental", "thats awesome": "surprised", "I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise. ": "trusting", "Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?": "surprised", "I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.": "caring", "Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!": "caring", "I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.": "sad", "I am sorry to hear that. How far along is it?": "sad", "It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.": "surprised", "Keep a positive attitude. I will be thinking of you!": "hopeful", "Thank you so much for being supportive. :)": "proud", "I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.": "terrified", "Did you find out what happened?": "embarrassed", "Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.": "terrified", "Man. That must've been really nerve wrecking. Did you get any sleep?": "anxious", "Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.": "afraid", "I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.": "surprised", "did it turn out ok ?": "terrified", "Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.": "sad", "hopes he continues to get better": "sad", "Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.": "annoyed", "I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...": "devastated", "I'm so sorry!  Don't lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  It'll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.": "ashamed", "I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.": "surprised", "I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus, it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebody,com and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldn't even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!": "hopeful", "Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly": "nostalgic", "Sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?": "nostalgic", "Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right": "nostalgic", "I've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it": "nostalgic", "I had a job interview recently": "confident", "Oh, how did it go?": "embarrassed", "Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.": "prepared", "I'm sorry, I am sure you will be ready next time.": "anxious", "Speaking of co-workers, one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes, and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.": "sad", "Wait, why would you be annoyed by that? That's amazing!": "annoyed", "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.": "surprised", "I think you need to look at the bigger picture, though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.": "jealous", "I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me": "lonely", "What movie did you see": "nostalgic", "Jurassic World. It was okay.": "afraid", "Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest": "embarrassed", "I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.": "annoyed", "Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?": "surprised", "Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge. ": "disgusted", "Damn well, he's gonna have to learn some boundaries with that.": "sad", "I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones": "disappointed", "It is indeed unfair, they shouldn't have done that": "angry", "I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms": "sad", "you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!": "annoyed", "I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain": "disgusted", "I bet that was awkward": "embarrassed", "Yeah, nobody said anything": "embarrassed", "I guess that happens sometimes, did you finish the game": "embarrassed", "My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!": "faithful", "That is terrible and a little odd!": "furious", "Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!": "faithful", "Wait, you were ok with her cheating?": "trusting", "Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.": "surprised", "I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.": "trusting", "Yes indeed! what did you do?": "surprised", "I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.": "caring", "You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!": "surprised", "Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.": "proud", "That's great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done!": "proud", "No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(": "disappointed", "Oh, I see what you are saying!  Did he get upset about it?  And you never know, he could turn it around next year and blow you away!": "disappointed", "He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.": "hopeful", "So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?": "impressed", "Wow, is that true? That's pretty amazing! I'd say science should know about your dog.": "impressed", "I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.": "surprised", "Wow, that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!": "impressed", "I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.": "impressed", "Dang, that's a lot of dogs. Cleaned out the pound, you did. But that doesn't hold a candle to the 100 I ate yesterday.": "disgusted", "Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!": "apprehensive", "How dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? I would watch out, friend. I may just slip some cyanide in your relish if I ever have the chance to challenge you!": "surprised", "Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.": "afraid", "I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though": "disgusted", "That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?": "caring", "Yes, I feel much better now.": "sad", "That's good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.": "hopeful", "I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.": "nostalgic", "That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones.": "nostalgic", "Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!": "sentimental", "Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but she's the best? Are you being sarcastic?": "guilty", "I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.": "trusting", "My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.": "furious", "That's a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!": "devastated", "I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.": "disgusted", "Serves her right! These animals can't go around thinking they can poop on our things!": "disgusted", "Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.": "impressed", "Holy moses, he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play.": "annoyed", "Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.": "disappointed", "Yeah, that's what they tell everyone because, in reality, they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.": "annoyed", "I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.": "jealous", "Ahh, that's too bad, did you mention it to your boss?": "annoyed", "My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea. ": "furious", "Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!": "disappointed", "My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.": "sad", "I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.": "sad", "Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected. ": "surprised", "I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.": "hopeful", "I broke up with my boyfriend last week, and nothing is the same without him.": "lonely", "Time will make it better. You just have to move on.": "sad", "Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.": "prepared", "Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me it's worse.": "lonely", "I just made the most delicious pie": "content", "Really? What kind was it?": "surprised", "It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.": "impressed", "Oh I love apple pie with ice cream, it's such a good combination": "content", "I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.": "disgusted", "Nice, I wish I could get a pair of those shoes.": "jealous", "I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's": "faithful", "How much did you pay for them?": "surprised", "I just went camping and build the warmest fire.": "prepared", "I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.": "surprised", "Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.": "grateful", "Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.": "content", "I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.": "terrified", "That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.": "terrified", "I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.": "terrified", "Oh yeah that's a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.": "content", "I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai": "anxious", "Why are you worried?": "apprehensive", "These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic ": "impressed", "That is true but Dubai is a bit better": "disappointed", "I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.": "surprised", "Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?": "embarrassed", "Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.": "afraid", "You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.": "annoyed", "I can't help feel stressed about money": "anxious", "why? are you having financial problems?": "apprehensive", "Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700": "grateful", "oh god , that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!": "disgusted", "I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family": "lonely", "Oh no, what did you do to stay cheerful ?": "lonely", "lol I played xbox games": "excited", "Sounds good, when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?": "caring", "I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems. ": "confident", "what kind of health problems ?": "anxious", "Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized": "content", "i'm glad you feel good today!": "content", "You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.": "afraid", "lol! I remember those drills when I was a kid!": "nostalgic", "Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.": "afraid", "And your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!": "prepared", "Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?": "confident", "I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.": "anxious", "That's normal. Try to just be your self. I'm sure it will work out fine.": "anxious", "I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!": "hopeful", "Amen, me too.   I hate my current job.": "hopeful", "This is going to sound really pathetic, but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!": "content", "It's not crazy! I'm all about cleaning up. I LOVE the smell of clean house": "disgusted", "Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.": "annoyed", "I find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum :) I bet it will smell so good": "hopeful", "Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.": "annoyed", "My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.": "impressed", "That's good. I know that would be difficult.": "faithful", "She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha": "proud", "That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!": "confident", "I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.": "content", "That's always both an exciting time and a nerve-wracking time. I'm in college and I had to move the past two years in a row. This year, I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put, even though the apartment was just so-so. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?": "apprehensive", "Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!": "annoyed", "Oh yeah, I know the type. Where they sound like they're having a parade at 3AM. Sorry you had to go through that. Luckily (or unluckily, if you want to see it that way) I have a loud window AC unit in my apartment, so even if they did make noise, I couldn't hear them over it!": "afraid", "Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.": "annoyed", "Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.": "afraid", "Oh wow that is a huge commitment! How did it go?": "proud", "It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do. ": "joyful", "That is really awesome! Im glad it all worked out for you!": "joyful", "Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.": "afraid", "Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?": "nostalgic", "Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!": "nostalgic", "It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.": "content", "I agree and time jut goes by too fast!": "nostalgic", "I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.": "nostalgic", "Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?": "nostalgic", "As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.": "disappointed", "Exhaust all options, social media is a big way to stay connected": "jealous", "Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently, one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me, without my saying anything!": "surprised", "Wow!  What was in the package?": "surprised", "It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.": "grateful", "That was really nice!  What a wonderful surprise!  This act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity.": "trusting", "The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!": "disgusted", "My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh, i miss her so much": "nostalgic", "Nice do you still keep in touch with her": "sentimental", "yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer": "lonely", "Well if you stay in touch then I'm sure she'll come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her": "faithful", "For me, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.": "content", "What book do you enjoy reading?": "content", "Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?": "content", "No, actually I'm under a lot of stress right now and I'm in pretty dire straights financially. The only book i'm really reading at this time is the Bible.": "content", "There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.": "sad", "My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!": "furious", "Where is your home village?": "excited", "In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!": "terrified", "That's a shame. I\"m sorry to hear that.": "sad", "Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.": "disgusted", "Do you live in the United States now?": "impressed", "Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.": "nostalgic", "Yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up.": "nostalgic", "i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need": "caring", "I love dogs!

We have blue healers, they just make the world better.": "caring", "One time as a surprise for my birthday, my college friends \"kidnapped me\"": "surprised", "Oh my goodness, that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on.": "afraid", "Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).": "trusting", "Well at least you had a good time.  Did they do something nice for you after?": "surprised", "Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.": "surprised", "i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street, i get really angry and sad at the same time": "furious", "Do you ever offer to help thm?": "surprised", "yes i go to my local charity every weekend": "caring", "GOod for you, I feel bad for never helping out.": "guilty", "I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.": "surprised", "Awesome.  What are you going to do with the money.": "prepared", "I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much. ": "surprised", "Don't spend it all in one place :)": "surprised", "I'll try not to.

If you feel that way again please reach out.": "content", "I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!": "disgusted", "Oh my, you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.": "annoyed", "I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him ": "furious", "Aw he's just a kitty after all. I'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.": "furious", "I was confident that I was going to win that prize": "confident", "What prize was it, or what was the competition, rather? I'm interested to know, but don't want to pry, if you don't feel like saying.": "impressed", "It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok": "surprised", "Ah, gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things, myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested.": "jealous", "We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap": "guilty", "Was it any good?": "surprised", "It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was ": "apprehensive", "Sometimes the cheap things are the best": "jealous", "it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother": "sad", "I bet it is!

His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.": "guilty", "I'm sorry to hear that.  Just knowing that he has you to lean on probably goes a very long way in helping him get through that.": "caring", "My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious": "jealous", "Oh no! Were you envious because you liked her yourself, or because you don't have a wealthy husband?": "jealous", "She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world. I wish that were me some days.": "jealous", "It can be you, you just have to work hard for it.": "jealous", "I was at a get together recently and a friend's husband was flirting with me.": "faithful", "i feel bad for your friend. did you tell her?": "guilty", "I didn't know what to say to her, and was afraid she wouldn't believe me and it would cause her to be angry at me.

I didn't want her to yell at me. I'm much older and wiser now!": "furious", "I want to trick my butler into thinking he won the lottery. I've taped the local new's winning lottery numbers and I'm going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler": "surprised", "That's hilarious! Is he usually down for a good prank?": "annoyed", "I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin": "annoyed", "Well, that's fair. If he pulls them, he has to be willing to have them pulled on him, too.": "surprised", "My friend just took her kids to Disneyland and I feel a little bad about it.": "guilty", "Why's that?": "afraid", "I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years.

There was this girl who really treated me poorly - I can't wait for her to see how successful I have been!": "excited", "Well I hope she's there. Maybe she'll regret how she treated you.": "guilty", "A hurricane hit my city. The first night I thought the wind was going to tear the roof off the house ": "afraid", "Oh no! Hurricanes are scary.  I've been through a few myself.  Was it your first one?": "terrified", "It was my third. Luckily we didn't lose power for more than a few hours": "annoyed", "I lost power in our last hurricane for 3 days.  Did the wind do any damage to your home?": "prepared", "It damaged the roof and the fence. We lost power for six days during the first hurricane I experienced": "prepared", "In the end, I'd rather be  in a hurricane than a snow storm.  lol": "prepared", "I am loyal to my principles, that is why I do not eat meat, because I love life ": "faithful", "Wow,  you are a vegetarian?

I love to see all the pictures, and think back to how little mine used to be.": "nostalgic", "I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly": "nostalgic", "They do seem to be grown before you know it.  Make you wonder how if goes so fast!": "nostalgic", "So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints, and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.": "guilty", "Sometimes it's ok to indulge. Did it give you a stomachache though lol?": "embarrassed", "LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes.

They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind": "furious", "I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.": "disappointed", "I am sure they had their reasons, maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright. They may be going through their own problems right now. ": "sad", "The older I get, the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.": "content", "I agree. The sound of birdsong, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, the purring of your tabby-cat.

I hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve.": "faithful", "I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.": "faithful", "Sugar is very addicting! I'm glad you could make it": "confident", "Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.": "annoyed", "Caffeine headaches are no joke.": "annoyed", "No, they suck!!": "furious", "I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt, my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced, which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.": "ashamed", "Sounds like you were just misunderstood. I discuss things with my husband, too, and it's not like talking behind someone's back. That's what married couples do. Don't feel bad. ": "guilty", "Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..": "guilty", "Yes, just tell her your home is a safe place to talk. It's okay to open up in the family. ": "sad", "That's good advice. Thanks!": "trusting", "I found huge box full of my old cd's recently, found a ton of old pc games i used to play, reminded me of a simpler time!": "nostalgic", "Awesome!

You must be disappointed. But remember if the door doesn't open, it probably wasn't yours. There's something else in store for you!": "embarrassed", "Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.

Your time will come.": "afraid", "When my wife left me, i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest, I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic ": "faithful", "I can't even imagine how devastating that would be. I think you must be really strong to be able to move forward.": "sad", "Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying.

I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.": "disappointed", "That must have been aggravating! Job hunting is so hard.": "annoyed", "It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.": "jealous", "Maybe something better will come along!": "jealous", "The other day I was running late. So, I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.": "terrified", "Well I hope you got there in time and nothing bad happened.": "terrified", "I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains.

So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.": "annoyed", "That's rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you. Never settle for less than what you are willing to settle for.": "disappointed", "My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it, we've been getting along great since we broke up.": "jealous", "Why did yall break up?": "jealous", "The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much. He decided he didn't want to leave after all and wants to keep working 70+ hour weeks every week.": "angry", "That doesnt leave much time for yalls relationship": "trusting", "I came home today and the food I had put in the crock pot was ruined. The outlet must have died and the food sat in there all day not cooking.": "disgusted", "Oh darn I hate when that happens! I've experienced the same thing in the past once.": "terrified", "Yeah it was pretty terrible. I had to throw out a TON of food, and to add insult to injure I had to go eat out tonight.": "disgusted", "Yep not always a terrible time to eat out at least.": "disgusted", "I let my friend babysit my kid last week. ": "trusting", "How did they do?": "furious", "Awesome. I usually have a hard time letting anyone watch my child but he had a great time with her.": "surprised", "How old's your child?": "sentimental", "Just barely older than my son. I can definitely understand that.": "jealous", "I was out walking by the lake over the weekend and there shore was just covered in dead rotting fish.": "disgusted", "what happened why were their so many dead fish?": "disgusted", "I don't know, that's what I would like to know! The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution. ": "terrified", "I hope they are not using the lake for drinking water .": "disgusted", "I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league. ": "anticipating", "Good luck! I'm sure it will be fine.": "hopeful", "I just don't want to embarrass myself or my team. I'm so scared i'm going to make a fool of myself. ": "terrified", "You're too hard on yourself. Everyone messes up sometimes, even the greats.": "embarrassed", "Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches. ": "terrified", "Yikes that's no good. How many stitches did you have to get?": "disappointed", "I had to get 2 stitches in one of the holes and 1 stitch and all the other holes. He was a big dog, a little over 50 pounds.": "proud", "What happened to the dog afterwards?": "furious", "Last year I made a bet with my friend and he lost, so he had to buy me a Nintendo Switch. I was so great.": "surprised", "That's quite the win! What was the bet?": "surprised", "I made a bet that he would not lose 20 pounds in 3.5 months. I was hoping that he would win the bet, but on the bright side I got a switch :) Win-win for me.": "disappointed", "Oh! Gotcha! I've never played the switch but I heard it's an exciting console!": "excited", "I am visiting my friend this week.": "excited", "Oh cool, where does your friend live? Is it an exciting location?": "excited", "Yes, I mean I promised her I would  and some things came up but I know I gotta stick to my word and make this happen.": "faithful", "Oh man, don't bail on your trip. Try and get those thing that came taken care of this week. You don't want to disappoint her.": "annoyed", "Oh I know I can't. She had lots of plans for us.": "sad", "One time when I was little and playing hide and go seek, my cousin talked me into remaining hidden even when our parents came looking for us. After a while I realized that we were going to be in trouble, and then we saw a police car pull into the drive way.": "terrified", "Oh no, I bet your parents were freaking out.": "furious", "Yeah I guess they were, they made sure to spank me and ground me for 2 weeks. I was also told that I was a terrible influence on my 9 year old cousin, even though I was 7 and it was his idea. ": "surprised", "Oh that sucks getting blamed for it when it was their fault.": "furious", "So we are moving and I'm having trouble letting go of a sewing machine my grandma gave me. Thinking I should keep it.": "sentimental", "Do you get much use out of it, or is it just collection dust?": "impressed", "Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.": "surprised", "I guess you can hang on to it, or maybe there's someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin'.": "annoyed", "One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.": "jealous", "well dang! that is very impressive! ": "impressed", "Yeah I know, I'm really amazed and proud of him. To be honest as proud as I am I can't help but to be a little jealous too lol.": "impressed", "Understandable, i bet the had good budgeting skills and a nice job.": "jealous", "I stayed at a friends house for the weekend a while back, and when I got home my bedroom was destroyed": "devastated", "Oh no!! That is terrible, do you know what happened? ": "embarrassed", "My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it": "furious", "Oh no, I am sure they meant no harm, they always say that they are more curious when they are young. ": "trusting", "Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me, because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.": "ashamed", "It will pass in time, even though it feels awful right now.": "sad", "I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable. I just wish I had someone here with me right now. ": "lonely", "Aw I'm sorry. I remember feeling like that and it was horrible.": "sad", "My husband and I celebrated 9 years Saturday. It was such a good day of quality family time.": "joyful", "Oh that's great! 9 years together is a long time.

": "surprised", "Yes, dinner :)": "surprised", "I went to the zoo last month, I haven't been since I was a kid. I went to a zoo that was supposed to be one of the top zoos, however I couldn't help but feel bad for the animals the whole time.": "terrified", "Oh, I know exactly what you mean. It's not the same as going as a kid.": "nostalgic", "The enclosures all just seemed so tiny and it felt like none of the animals were able to have any privacy if they wanted it. ": "terrified", "Yeah, it's no wonder these animals go crazy on humans sometimes.": "disgusted", "I won an essay contest and I get to go to Washington DC for free!": "confident", "Wow! what did you write about?": "surprised", "I wrote about social security reform. Kinda boring stuff lol but it'll be fun to visit all the sites in DC": "nostalgic", "Nice, well I hope you have a nice trip!": "excited", "We are moving. I'm so pumped for new adventures. ": "excited", "Congrats! That's exciting. Is the new place far from your current home?": "hopeful", "Yes, a new state. I am just imagining all the fun things and new things we can do.": "anticipating", "Wow, thats really big! I hope you have a stress free move. I know it can be a little stressful, but you seem very excited!": "hopeful", "When I was in middle school there was this boy that sat in front of me in 8th, he was always trying to get me to kiss him before class started.": "faithful", "Wow, really? Did you have any feelings for him? ": "faithful", "No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.": "ashamed", "Hahaha, that is so cute, I am sure he loved that you teased him like that! I bet your classmates also had a good laugh! ": "surprised", "I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field": "hopeful", "Wow!

": "impressed", "She is but she's taking her husband :)": "caring", "I saw  man swallow a sword": "disgusted", "Wow, were you at a festival?": "excited", "Yes I was. I thought it was pretty intense to watch": "afraid", "I have seen that before. I have no idea how they can do that.": "surprised", "I've been packing, packing, packing and cleaning. ": "prepared", "o That sounds exciting. Moving or spring cleaning?": "excited", "Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.": "prepared", "Ya last time I moved I was packing for about 6 months. It's smarter to do it a little at a time and get things purged and organized. ": "prepared", "Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.": "furious", "Oh no that is terrible, I can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! How bad was the accident? ": "furious", "Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.": "annoyed", "Wow, that is terrible. I hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it, because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots.": "furious", "I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.": "nostalgic", "Aww were you excited when you picked her up?": "surprised", "Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.": "surprised", "I bet! What kind of dog is she?": "caring", "My brother isn't very good with money but i just lent him some": "trusting", "Uh oh, be careful about that, you don't want him becoming dependent on you for handouts. ": "guilty", "Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time": "trusting", "Well that's good. I hope it works out for both of you, maybe you could give him some budgeting tips. ": "angry", "I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.": "disgusted", "Oh my god, you should have reported her.": "furious", "I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.": "furious", "I am really appalled at people these days.": "disgusted", "So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.": "hopeful", "Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.": "anxious", "Me too. Well I hope it is to somewhere that you like.": "hopeful", "So I interviewed for my dream job last week and I didn't get it.": "disappointed", "I'm sorry to hear that.

I was really wanting that job.": "hopeful", "Just remember to keep your head up and don't give up!": "embarrassed", "So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.": "disgusted", "I do hope they stopped the car at least ! That sounds disgusting, but its better than throwing up in the car right ?": "disgusted", "Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.": "disgusted", "I can imagine when something unexpected like that happens. I do hope they are ok now :) Sorry you had to witness that !": "surprised", "I am so ready to find out where we are moving to.": "prepared", "New adventures!

There were so many to chose from, but I couldn't help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years.": "trusting", "You gotta stick with what you know sometimes.": "guilty", "Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well. ": "impressed", "That's right. There's so sense in deviating. ": "embarrassed", "I have to show some brand loyalty! ": "faithful", "I have so much to do today, but it's raining. I'm OK with just staying at home and doing nothing.": "content", "I feel you there, I have a ton of stuff to do, but I can't get any of it done in this rain. ": "content", "It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.": "annoyed", "I really hope so, I am not sure how much longer I can let my yard grow before it gets too wild. ": "hopeful", "My dog I had for five years just passed away. He was hit by a car last night.": "devastated", "oh I am so sorry.

": "caring", "When I go out to a restaurant, I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not, my food could be \"gluten free\" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.": "faithful", "What kind of illness occurs if food is cross contaminated? I'm so sorry this happens to you.": "disgusted", "If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!": "annoyed", "You suffer from it more severely than most people I know, this can be devastating to people. ": "sad", "Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.": "grateful", "We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!": "annoyed", "Wow that is weird.  I love Diet Coke.

I like the new Freestyle machines, it's always just right.": "surprised", "While cleaning out our closets, I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make \"jean purses\" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!": "nostalgic", "aww. I understand you. That feeling is priceless.": "jealous", "It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.": "sentimental", "It's alright to feel such sentiments buddy :)": "sad", "My wife made me pancakes for breakfast. I have a full belly and feel rather happy now. ": "content", "Yum!!! I love pancakes. Is it your favorite food too?": "excited", "One of my favorite breakfast foods.

There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up. ": "surprised", "Time goes by so fast. You'll see. ": "nostalgic", "Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big. ": "excited", "LOL, well there is always luck!": "anxious", "I am in the process of potty training my daughter, but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day, we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.": "disgusted", "I remember those potty training days!!!    I bet you were so embarrassed.": "embarrassed", "It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.": "embarrassed", "THank goodness you had extra supplies on hand.   My son was the hardest one out of my 3 kids to potty train.   I feel your pain!!": "annoyed", "I ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday.": "annoyed", "Oh, did you give it to him yet?": "jealous", "No, not yet. But, I can't wait to!

I had to take him to the hospital.": "sad", "Is he okay now?": "trusting", "Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, I have been in a rut lately. Last week, during revival, for the first few nights, everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason, and it made me feel bad.": "surprised", "Oh, I know what you mean. I have felt that way. Best thing to do is pray about it and don't be hard on yourself.": "hopeful", "Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.": "nostalgic", "That's amazing! I'm so happy your prayers were answered. God knows your heart.": "grateful", "Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.": "grateful", "Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.": "ashamed", "I've never done that but i know plenty of people who do that.

I hope you all had a ton of fun!": "joyful", "My wife bought some new clothes and in classic fashion she lied about how much she actually spent.": "jealous", "Hahaha, yes we women don't want to get the men angry. But clothes are so expensive these days. We just want to look good for our men.": "jealous", "I know I know. I just wish she could tell me up front. I get more irritated finding out she lied about it.": "annoyed", " I guess you can just tell her like you told me just now. Maybe she won't be afraid to tell you next time....... well maybe, lol.": "guilty", "Oh, I've tried...": "ashamed", "This weekend I saw one woman being kind of mean to another woman of color.": "jealous", "Yikes, that doesnt happen too often in today's culture.  Did you say anything?": "annoyed", "No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.": "impressed", "That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?": "annoyed", "No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.": "jealous", "Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.": "annoyed", "I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently, but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.": "sad", "I'm sorry you don't get to see her much. I don't see mine often either. I'm sure it did make you sad.": "sad", "We just dont live super close so it always makes it harder.": "jealous", "Yeah, I understand that. I live about 45 minutes from mine and everyone is so busy all the time. Maybe you will be able to see her soon.": "annoyed", "The last few weeks have been spent buys school clothes, shoes, and supplies so my girls would be ready to go back to school.

Are you home all day or do you just get them off to school and then head to work yourself?": "prepared", "I'm home with my toddler, so I drop them off and pick them up. The school is exactly 7 minutes away. I'm glad my shopping in advance paid off.": "annoyed", "For sure! I bet it was nice to have the hosue a little more quiet too.": "nostalgic", "Recently had some test run at the doctors office and it took a few weeks to get the results back.": "anxious", "Oh that must have been torture! Is everything alright?": "afraid", "Yes fortunately everything turned out ok. But it was nerve wracking waiting on the answer.": "anxious", "I can imagine. Glad you are ok though! :)": "terrified", "My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.": "surprised", "Oh no! that's no bueno. Usually the person that wants the least deserves the most. Thats sad": "disgusted", "It really is. The worst part is that they had arguments in front of him, while he was sick, about who should get what. I wish they would have spent that time just loving and comforting him. That's what my husband and I tried to do.": "disgusted", "Oh that's awful and borderline abusive": "furious", "Yes, the whole situation made me mad then and mad now. There is nothing I can do though except pray about it.": "angry", "Watching my daughters play volley ball with their team makes me remember all the games I played in with my friends. ": "nostalgic", "ah, you must have great memories than": "nostalgic", "The memories are awesome and I miss playing.But I wouldn't trade the life I live now to go back,": "nostalgic", "you know today's events are tomorrow's memories": "nostalgic", "I am going fishing at my favorite spot tomorrow.

": "impressed", "It's always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.": "impressed", "It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.": "sad", "You must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it.": "surprised", "I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!": "nostalgic", "I would assume so, since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!": "surprised", "Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!": "surprised", "I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.": "grateful", "Congrats! is it a good promotion?": "proud", "It is!

Good for you, you must be nervous. ": "confident", "On the one hand, I am but on the other hand I have to relax knowing I did everything I could do and worked as hard as I could.  It's kinda out of my hands now.": "content", "That's great, what kind of work are you in?": "grateful", "I work for a medical supply company.": "annoyed", "Well I really hope you get it. You're right, you did what you could. ": "hopeful", "Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.": "disgusted", "That's horrible news!  I don't understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.": "furious", "I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!": "furious", "I know in some places, the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids.  Nothing makes sense sometimes.

Summer can get long. ": "surprised", "It can.  But we had fun!  Visited lots of relatives, cooked lots of stuff, goofed off and watched more anime than is probably humanly possible...a part of me is enjoying the quiet but on the other hand, I miss having my kids around to do stuff with.": "content", "Oh, that does sound like a fun summer. I read recently that we only get 18 summers with our kids- make them count. ": "content", "Yep - and I have two left with the older one.  They do grow up so fast!": "nostalgic", "It's good to stop and appreciate teh moment sometimes. ": "grateful", "I had to clean beneath a desk which had not been cleaned in about three years, after there had been some flooding from a manufacturing unit. It was so gross!": "disgusted", "Oh no, I can imagine so! Was it gunky?": "terrified", "Yes indeed, there was even a frog under there! So bizarre! ": "disgusted", "Oh goodness, glad you got through is safe lol": "terrified", "They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!": "disgusted", "Oh, that's not right. I have a rescue dog, she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year. ": "annoyed", "Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.": "annoyed", "I could chat with you all day! We have a lot in common- I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals. ": "content", "Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.": "trusting", "That's great! So sad for those poor animals. ": "caring", "And in my opinion, the bond for those people was nowhere near high enough - they should have had to stay in jail!": "terrified", "They should- they say people who hurt animals will hurt people too.

I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, \"Mom, you always watch this!\" comment!": "excited", "That sounds seriously like a dream. I cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school.": "anticipating", "How old are they?": "sentimental", "4 and 1. I have a bit to go haha.": "content", "Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.  LOL": "content", "My two best friends are going on vacation next week and I won't have anyone else at work to goof off with.": "lonely", "Awww that will be a boring week. Sorry to hear that.

Did the dog cause any harm?": "trusting", "He was growling at me and looked like he wanted to bite me, the neighbor finally came out and called him home. was intense. ": "terrified", "Sounds scary! Dogs are very loyal creatures but can cause a lot of harm": "faithful", "The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.": "sad", "That is very heartbreaking. How did you find the kitten?": "sad", "She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.": "sad", "Very sad to hear. You have a good heart and are very caring, that is something to atleast be proud of!": "caring", "And that kitten knew she was loved.

A few days later she was playing no problem!": "surprised", "Kids pick those things up quickly.  And it'll help with her hand-eye coordination, reading - all sorts of things!  ": "caring", "Yea, i was pretty proud of her, especially since things are more complicated now than when i was a kid. ": "impressed", "Yeah.  Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start, Select, A and B!": "embarrassed", "I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.": "surprised", "Oh no! Hopefully you are able to get it sorted out. It's hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling.": "disappointed", "I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!": "disappointed", "Sounds like a headache, i know the feeling.

Good luck!": "hopeful", "I went through a divorce last year, which caught me off guard financially, luckily my mom was able to help with some of the costs.": "grateful", "That would be rough.  Hopefully youre in a better spot now!  Thats awesome you had family to help you out too!": "grateful", "Yea i'm much better now, thanks to my mom.

We have to make time for ourselves.": "anxious", "I really do miss my mother. She has been dead for about 15 years now.": "sad", "I'm very sorry for your loss. Thinking about and remember all of your good memories with her may help.": "sad", "It is a blessing and curse. When I am having problems I think about what she would say to me.": "grateful", "That's a good way to remember her and keep her close to your heart.": "sentimental", "Yes, it is. I know that time heals.": "sad", "Yes, it does. ": "proud", "My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings. So, I would have to let go and let them fly.": "surprised", "That can't be easy. How old are your children? Sometimes I wish we could keep our kids small forever!": "sentimental", "I have 23, 20, 17 and 14. They are doing stuff that I question but I don't want them to not tell me stuff.": "annoyed", "Yeah you want them to learn, but it's definitely hard to see them doing things that you might not agree with. ": "jealous", "When I was in labor with my third child, they were monitoring me regularly in the hospital. The nurse came in and made a face and then called the doctor. In the 2 minutes it took for him to get to my room, my heart dropped and I started to panic. He told me that the baby's heart rate had dropped and they had to preform an emergency C-section right then.": "afraid", "Wow that's really scary! Labor is a really terrifying thing, especially when something like that happens. Did everything turn out okay?": "afraid", "Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.": "terrified", "I can imagine. When I was in the hospital with my 3 year old they lost all his vitals as well. Kids like to keep us on our toes from the start!": "devastated", "Yes, they do. I ope your boy is all good now.": "caring", "I finally beat level 150 on the crucible today in my favorite game Grim Dawn.": "excited", "What platform do you play it on? PC or PS4?": "excited", "PC all the way. I've been grinding devotion points all week.": "faithful", "PC is the way to go for gaming. That sounds like an awesome type of game. Is it multiplayer?": "excited", "I just found a hello kitty pot in my daughters room filled with water and old flowers.": "surprised", "That's so cute. How old is she?": "proud", "It's not cute, and she's nine. By old flowers I mean, it's a green, stagnant slush with mold growing on top.": "sad", "Oh mine. That is not cute.": "furious", "When I enter the bus, I fainted. I think that I got overheated.": "disappointed", "That's no good. Did you go to the doctor?": "afraid", "Yes I did. It was so hot outside and I did not have much to drink.": "disgusted", "Got to make sure you take care of your self. It's scary when your heat sensitive.": "anxious", "I got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of my friends": "embarrassed", "It will be okay. We sometimes do things that we regret.": "ashamed", "I fell down, and apparently said some embarrassing things. ": "embarrassed", "You have to forgive ourselves. We don't need others validation.": "ashamed", "My daughter is graduating from college. I cannot wait until she finish.": "proud", "Will you be able to spend more time with her?": "surprised", "Yes, I will. She has been under a lot of stress.": "caring", "I can imagine, but it's good that her hard work is about to pay off.": "proud", "Two years ago I got diagnosed with MS.": "sad", "What'd MS?": "joyful", "Its a disease that attacks the nervous system. It was really scary to find out I had it. I just went blind in my right eye one day. Two days and several test later I found out I had MS.": "anxious", "Well ,I pray you get through it": "hopeful", "I found out that my daughter is moving out. My youngest one told me so.": "sad", "How do you feel about that ?": "confident", "I feel really sad because I felt she should have told me.": "sad", "Hopefully she re considers you should talk to her about it": "annoyed", "I let my sister borrow my car. She is a new driver.": "trusting", "That is risky, what do you plan to do": "anxious", "Well, nothing. I'm sure that she will be a responsible driver.": "trusting", "Okey if she is no cause for alarm": "terrified", "I think that I will do good on my test.": "confident", "Good. You sound confident. When is it?": "confident", "It is tonight. I studied really hard.": "confident", "I'm sure you'll do great then!": "confident", "I heard a song that I hadn't heard in awhile. It reminded me of my high school days": "nostalgic", "Oh how sweet, high school days is always fun": "nostalgic", "Yes, it had me feeling nostalgic about the times when I was young. ": "nostalgic", "Yes it does happen": "afraid", "My dad dies when I was 33 years old.": "sad", "am sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace": "sad", "Thank you. I was crushed, and it left me with questions about my own mortality.": "devastated", "I hope you getting better now": "sad", "My mother fell and injured herself. I wanted help and comfort her in any way possible.": "caring", "Oh no! I'm sorry. Is she going to be ok?": "sad", "Yes, but bhe bruised her wrist, and had a concussion.

Hopefully she recovers quickly.": "guilty", "I had a nice meal and my favorite beverage after work": "content", "Thats great what is your favorite meal?": "content", "It was a skirt steak with avocados. I was very satisfied.": "content", "That sounds so good i love steaks": "content", "When I started a new job. I was nervous about proving myself all over again.": "apprehensive", "It can been nerve-wracking to start a new job. But I'm sure you did well, right?": "anxious", "I did, but I find it hard to trust people. Especially at work.": "trusting", "It's wise to be careful but suspecting people all the time may not be healthy. You need to build a good relationship with your new co-workers.": "trusting", "I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me. The problem is I am addicted to soda and Its very hard to quit. When I do manage to skip a day, the lack of caffeine causes horrible headaches.": "ashamed", "I know exactly how you feel. I have a crazy addiction to soda.  I don't think I can quit!": "ashamed", "It just makes me feel bad, that no matter how many times I try, I still give in to the temptation.": "ashamed", "Maybe try to slowly quit? Like just drink one less a day": "annoyed", "Yeah, I think that's what I will have to do. Thanks for the advice.": "apprehensive", "I went on a job interview. I'm anxiously waiting to hear if I got the job.": "hopeful", "When will you find out?": "hopeful", "I still need wait another week.": "anticipating", "Oh the wait is terrible.  What type of job?": "anxious", "A drafter.": "confident", "I just went to clean my kids sink a few minutes ago. I found a bunch of toys in the catch and I am mad.": "furious", "Oh no! That is not good! Hopefully you were able to get them out. ": "furious", "Yeah, all the toys are out. But, they got some explaining to do after school.": "nostalgic", "LOL! I'm sure. Don't be too rough on them.": "embarrassed", "I couldn't sleep last night. I ended up staying up till 2am and eating a large amount of Shepard's pie.": "ashamed", "Why couldn't you sleep?": "afraid", "Combination of stress and new meds I think. Maybe I can get back to my old scheduled soon.": "sad", "I hope so! Why are you stressed?": "anxious", "I saw my crush talking to another guy.": "impressed", "Oh, that sounds uncomfortable. How did you play it?": "apprehensive", "I was a little upset, but it wasn't my business. I let it go.": "disappointed", "I respect that, I think it shows character and honor. I'm hoping something rewarding comes your way.": "hopeful", "When I went to the store the other day, I seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs.": "disgusted", "Oh geez, thats not good.  Was he bothering anyone?": "embarrassed", "No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.": "terrified", "I dont blame you.  I probably would have done the same thing.": "ashamed", "Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.": "proud", "I remember that feeling with my daughter, it is indescribable.": "nostalgic", "Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.": "jealous", "There is nothing to compare it to. I wish I hadn't been waking from anesthesia in that moment so I could have been more awake. ": "afraid", "I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!": "guilty", "Oh no! It happens to the best of us :) Have you talked to her about it when you remembered?": "embarrassed", "Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)": "surprised", "Awww I'm sure she completely understood and really appreciated you reaching out and going to visit her!": "sad", "She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!": "sad", "I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day, and I found all my old paintball gear.": "nostalgic", "Oh, how cool! Dd you and your dad play together?": "impressed", "No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.": "excited", "That's great. It'll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family.": "nostalgic", "I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!": "trusting", "Wow, that is scary. Were you nervous?": "afraid", "Absolutely!

He gave it away because it wouldn't hunt.": "surprised", "How did you feel when he gave it away? ": "sentimental", "I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.": "sad", "Yeah I would have been too. As a nine year old kid that's hard to deal with. ": "sad", "I tripped and fell in front of some people.": "embarrassed", "Ouch! Was it a serious fall?": "embarrassed", "No, only my pride was injured.": "embarrassed", "That's a relatively quick recovery, fortunately. ": "afraid", "I recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when I was young for a birthday. I hadn't seen it in years.": "sentimental", "Oh my.. that must have been very sad. I can't even imagine how you must have felt. ": "sad", "Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!": "nostalgic", "I'm so sorry.! But I'm really glad you've got those pleasant memories and the memento to hold on to so you can remember her fondly. ": "nostalgic", "I just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood! ": "joyful", "Wow that's great, you must have put a lot of work into your yard.": "grateful", "I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off. ": "impressed", "Cool, I guess the grass is actually greener in your yard now!": "surprised", "It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.": "annoyed", "I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!": "excited", "Ooh nice. That does sound like alot of fun. Do you guys play any sport while your there? ": "impressed", "We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports. ": "afraid", "Cool. Well enjoy, I hope the weather hold up.": "hopeful", "Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!": "excited", "Yeah, I haven't seen my friends in forever. We don't even live in the same state anymore.": "nostalgic", "I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.": "guilty", "I understand that feeling. I've had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too. Has your diet been going well otherwise?": "ashamed", "Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.": "ashamed", "Wow, congratulations! Sugar is one of the hardest things to kick, I don't have the knack for it either, but still you're making great progress!": "surprised", "My childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago, I lost it in a move recently. I'm pretty upset by it.": "sad", "Oh no!  It always seems like things get lost when you move doesn't it?  Is there anyway you can go back and see if its at your old place?": "sad", "I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!": "hopeful", "It will probably be where you least expect it!": "surprised", "I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.": "surprised", "Oh wow.  How did she do?": "surprised", "She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.": "impressed", "That's awesome!  That's great exercise! ": "confident", "It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.": "devastated", "Oh, no! That's so terrible!": "furious", "It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.": "furious", "I'm so sorry that happened! I'm glad she's okay, though.": "devastated", "I was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew. She drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!": "sad", "That is a great sister.

Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.": "terrified", "I was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently. It was wonderful to relax in my childhood home.": "nostalgic", "It's always nice to visit home. Did your parents enjoy your visit?": "nostalgic", "They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.": "surprised", "Ha ha! I bet. Dogs are the best. I bet he missed you just as much as they did.": "sad", "I've been thinking about buying some new, softer skateboard wheels.": "excited", "What makes you want to get softer wheels? Are those harder to skateboard on?": "jealous", "No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.": "apprehensive", "I didn't know that about softer wheels! Maybe in the future you can change to those.": "disappointed", "I took my dog I've had for years over to meet one of my husband's sisters the other night.": "caring", "Oh neat!  How did the little one handle it?": "impressed", "It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.": "annoyed", "Oh no!  Poor baby must have been really stressed out. ": "sad", "Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.": "embarrassed", "I had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day. She was very sick.": "caring", "Oh no!  Hopefully its just the flu.  What did they say?": "disgusted", "It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.": "caring", "That's good!  I hope she gets to feeling better soon.  The flu is no fun.": "caring", "So my sister is getting married in a few weeks.": "jealous", "Congratulations!

I bet it is so cute": "caring", "Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.": "jealous", "Do you plan on getting one": "hopeful", "Bought a new car a few months back. Couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through. I thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car.": "afraid", "oh man. i hate that. we've had some pretty nasty storms come through Austin in the last few months and luckily i've managed to be in some random parking garage out shopping or eating when they've rolled through.": "terrified", "Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.": "trusting", "lol. well that's no good. cleaning garages bites. ": "terrified", "I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.": "impressed", "i guess in your field of work you would run across terms and methods which are unfamiliar": "apprehensive", "That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level. ": "jealous", "you'll find some like that, not much you can do": "disappointed", "I had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion.": "hopeful", "How long did it take you to get your promotion?": "hopeful", "I've been working there for a couple years now.

I have a feeling you'll do great in your race.": "confident", "My wife has had a trip in mind ever since I've known her. She recently had a big birthday so I surprised her with the trip.

There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.": "surprised", "I'm glad you guys had a good time. Are you planning another trip?": "surprised", "Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.": "anticipating", "I live in Florida. When I go home once a year it is a grand occasion.": "excited", "Where is it that you go to go home? ": "excited", "I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.": "excited", "That's awesome. I love going back to my hometown to visit as well.

Good luck on your test, Im sure you will do fine.": "anxious", "I had phone interview for a job. It went very well": "confident", "great, i hope you get the job.": "hopeful", "Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.": "confident", "so you were really prepared. ": "prepared", "I saw an old movie. It reminded me of my younger days.": "nostalgic", "That's cool, good movies have a way of tapping into those feelings.": "nostalgic", "Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.": "nostalgic", "Sometimes it almost makes me want to go back somehow. But it's also important to move forward.": "disappointed", "I lost my job because my company didn't pay rent at our location.": "angry", "oh that is so wrong. How are you handling it?": "afraid", "Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.": "angry", "that's good you do that, I would be very frustrated too. That's really unfair. Can you pursue legal charges?": "angry", "Recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip.": "lonely", "Oh I bet that was fun. What kind of dog do you have?": "surprised", "I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.": "sad", "My husband was gone all weekend buying us a new puppy, so I understand feeling lonely! ": "lonely", "Our computer system at work is goofing up a lot, but the development team just keeps saying there's nothing wrong.": "annoyed", "Ugh, I bet that is really frustrating. Is it making it difficult to do your job?": "annoyed", "Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.": "annoyed", "That makes for long days at work. I hope they can fix it for you soon.": "annoyed", "Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies, and get new toys.": "sad", "Omg, I bet they come home so spoiled.": "jealous", "Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.": "nostalgic", "Yeah, what the heck I don't remember my mom being so nice when I was a kid! lol": "nostalgic", "I was really happy when my nephew was born, Sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.": "proud", "That's sad to hear. What's his prognosis?": "sad", "He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.": "proud", "Hopefully medical technology will catch up to where it needs to be for him. ": "hopeful", "I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.": "disappointed", "Oh no! I used to be a financial advisor so I'm sure that was frustrating. I hope you didn't lose too much money!": "disappointed", "Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.": "jealous", "As much as I hate they didn't go up in price for you, I'm so happy that you didn't overdo it.": "disappointed", "I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasnt done that in ages.": "disgusted", "Oh yuck! I'm sorry that that happened. What kind of dog is he? Is he sick?": "disgusted", "Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.": "caring", "Hopefully it was just a bad day for him and he won't do it again! I have a couple rescue mutts as well. ": "impressed", "Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok": "caring", "I work for a software company.

We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.": "apprehensive", "i can just imagine. I wish There was something that I could do to help.": "terrified", "It is ok.

We will make it.": "sad", "I pray and hope that something works out and that the good old faithful car will not bite the dust.": "hopeful", "So I recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls. It brought back a lot of memories!": "nostalgic", "That is always a fun thing to do! I hope the memories were all good!": "nostalgic", "Absolutely!

It felt dangerous!": "afraid", "that is dangerous, glad that both of your are okay": "afraid", "Look, can we just be honest with each other for a second? Having ebola shouldn't mean that I have to be grounded and miss out on my chance to walk on the moon during the upcoming lunar missions.": "lonely", "Okay, well if you have it then you would have to see a doctor.": "afraid", "I saw one, and he said if I gave him $25,000 he would clear me for flight, but I don't have that kind of money just lying around.

And I once almost got my finger bit off by a snapping turtle, it wasn't a pleasant experience so I couldn't imagine hers. You are great for staying there.": "surprised", "It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat.

What's been going on?": "excited", "I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting! ": "surprised", "Woo! Congrats on that! That's always a nice surprise. What do you do?": "surprised", "Music is a powerful thing. Sometimes it feels like it can transport you to another time and place. You know what I mean?": "sad", "Yeah exactly!  Music is awesome.  ": "surprised", "Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.": "sad", "Yeah he sounds amazing.  Sorry for your loss friend :(": "sad", "I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories. ": "nostalgic", "Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler, everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did, I'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm, you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else, there should be no shame.": "embarrassed", "Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.": "sentimental", "Well, if I were you, I'd keep it up, whether or not my spouse laughed at me, or a new girlfriend/boyfriend, whatever. It's not childish to me. Life is stressful enough. Let us snuggle what we want.": "embarrassed", "Aw! That's horrible, I'm sorry to hear that.": "sad", "He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.": "sad", "That's so sad, I don't even know what to say!": "sad", "Some random guy was in my backyard, I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.": "embarrassed", "Oh no! That is really creepy, why is he in your backyard?": "terrified", "Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first. ": "angry", "Yeah, that's illegal I think, they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!": "terrified", "My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.": "sad", "I am so sorry to hear that. It can't be easy for you and your family.": "sad", "My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story. It was just so sudden and unexpected.": "surprised", "No doubt it will take time to process. I wish your family the best. Stay strong my friend.": "sad", "I've got a week off from work. Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.": "content", "What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.": "surprised", "I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time": "excited", "Must be nice, got any nice snacks?": "surprised", "I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.": "apprehensive", "Good choice. You're health is more important than some grad degree. ": "confident", "That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.": "apprehensive", "I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that. ": "apprehensive", "I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.": "embarrassed", "Ah, I hate when that happens! How embarrassed were you?": "embarrassed", "It was pretty humiliating. I fell flat on my face.": "embarrassed", "Sorry to hear that. Hopefully you're not seriously hurt!

Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.": "surprised", "I am sure it was not as bad as you think. ": "embarrassed", "I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend. ": "confident", "Wow! What kind of meeting is it?": "excited", "It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.": "prepared", "Dang! I hope you have successful meeting then!": "confident", "Oh no, was it romantic texts?": "nostalgic", "It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her": "trusting", "That's sad. I hope you are OK.": "sad", "I know I broke up with my ex, but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.": "annoyed", "That must be weird to talk to your ex still.": "lonely", "We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple. I guess I still just get a littler territorial, i think he does too. ": "jealous", "You must have feelings for him that are lingering.": "caring", "I can't wait to see my final grades. I think I got all A's this semester.": "confident", "Nice! It feels good to be confident. When do they come out?": "confident", "On Monday.

You must have good teachers too!": "confident", "I was very upset when I found my kitten today.": "sad", "why? what happened to it? is it okay?": "afraid", "No, I had to put it down. It ate a poisonous plant. He should not have been outside.": "disgusted", "that sounds terrible, i hope you didn't cry alot.": "sad", "I cried a bit, but kept it together for my little girl because she had let him out.": "sad", "I enjoy visiting the nursing home on occasion.": "caring", "Oh yeah?  Do you know someone that lives there?": "lonely", "Not really, I take my daughter to see them, so many of them have no visitors at all.": "surprised", "Yeah.  That's awesome that you do that though.  Makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff.": "nostalgic", "She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)": "surprised", "That sounds cool!  I bet she cooks good!": "proud", "She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.": "proud", "haha same here!  ": "terrified", "I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her, as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.": "trusting", "I am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely.": "trusting", "Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!": "grateful", "Hopefully she knows how much this means to you.": "guilty", "My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us. I was anxious and nervous waiting to see if he was accepted!": "apprehensive", "DID HE GET ACCEPTED? I HOPE SO": "surprised", "He did!

She took her life, and my mother and I found her right after she did it. This was very painful, traumatic and hard for us all.": "sad", "oh wow, how did your mother handle this, how did you handle it . i can only imagine the pain.": "afraid", "It didn't really seem to sink in for my mother for awhile, she was in denial. But, it was so hard when it did. I went into a depression for awhile, as she was my only sibling and we were very close.": "devastated", "that is really painful, i hope everything becomes better soon.": "sad", "When my son first started college, I felt so much love and affection, but it was definitely hard to see him go! I was very proud though.": "proud", "where did he go study at? i can imagine how hard that could be. but it's good to see him following his dreams\\": "proud", "He went to the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.": "faithful", "Sounds like you have a good relationship. I hope when I get married it turns out just as good.": "faithful", "My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!": "nostalgic", "aww. im sure you must feel proud of him": "proud", "Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!": "impressed", "that sounds so cute": "caring", "I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.": "confident", "that is good news. its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead": "confident", "Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.": "proud", "i hope you do well and excell": "hopeful", "There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad, beyond angry!": "furious", "An adult did this? ": "impressed", "Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??": "surprised", "I dont get people sometimes. Who does that that sort of thing.": "jealous", "Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.": "caring", "Aww, they grow up so fast!!  How did she do?": "proud", "It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing. ": "disgusted", "haha, I'm sorry you were so upset for nothing!  But it's so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life.": "proud", "I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!": "prepared", "What went wrong?": "apprehensive", "I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.": "disappointed", "That is all that matters, its about the love.": "content", "One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!": "surprised", "I understand. Did you told your friend?": "guilty", "I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....": "caring", "Wow, it is terrible.": "disgusted", "The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.": "terrified", "Did you go see who it was?": "surprised", "No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though.

I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more": "joyful", "That is always difficult.": "lonely", "A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.": "ashamed", "I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.": "faithful", "Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later. ": "ashamed", "Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.": "guilty", "One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.": "afraid", "In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.": "afraid", "Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!": "afraid", "I hope you aren't still scared of your shadow?": "terrified", "There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.": "guilty", "I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.": "hopeful", "Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it. ": "guilty", "It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!": "grateful", "When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.": "lonely", "Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that. ": "sentimental", "Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.": "grateful", "Thats perfect, a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats. ": "joyful", "I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.": "trusting", "In what do you believe?": "surprised", "Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.": "jealous", "That is great. In what do your colleagues believe?": "surprised", "They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!": "angry", "I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.": "afraid", "What car did you buy?": "surprised", "Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.": "angry", "Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.": "annoyed", "I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.": "impressed", "Good luck! My sister-in-law has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.": "jealous", "It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them": "grateful", "You'll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments which'll sustain you throughout your life. How many meetings do you attend?": "lonely", "A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!": "anxious", "That test seems so hard. I probably couldn't even pass it. How did you do?": "confident", "I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!": "confident", "I didn't know that. Congratulations. That's so awesome.": "surprised", "Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!": "jealous", "I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.": "nostalgic", "That must have been nice. I keep cards too.": "surprised", "It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?": "ashamed", "Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards, photos, school projects. Everything. We arent here forever": "nostalgic", "That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!": "sentimental", "I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol": "sad", "I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.": "surprised", "Lol. Me too!!": "excited", "When I was entering the store it was really slippery.": "afraid", "Why was it slippery": "afraid", "It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.": "embarrassed", "Oh no, were you okay": "ashamed", "I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.": "lonely", "I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.": "ashamed", "Oh no. Why are you keeping the secret?": "guilty", "I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.": "disgusted", "Oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation. I hope you can get out of the middle of it!": "anxious", "Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.": "sad", "I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.": "surprised", "Oh I am sorry. Did you get any part?": "sad", "I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.": "disappointed", "I am glad you got a good part. I am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.": "hopeful", "It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.": "trusting", "I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!": "confident", "That is wonderful, I imagine she is very excited.": "surprised", "She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.": "caring", "Okay i see well, take your time she will be getting her liscense soon": "surprised", "Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.": "proud", "She just needs to get her confidence and I am sure you are a great teacher.": "confident", "I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!": "annoyed", "It will definitely paid off and I am rooting for her.": "hopeful", "My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.": "annoyed", "That can be overwhelming. Are you going to be cleaning all day then?": "excited", "I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*": "embarrassed", "I'm sure you will get it done!": "confident", "My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.": "trusting", "Thats neat. Do you guys make a lot of money?": "surprised", "We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.": "trusting", "I wish my siblings were like that. We should be more supportive and close like that": "sentimental", "We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.": "nostalgic", "I am jealous lol": "jealous", "Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)": "content", "I will work on it with my family. ": "hopeful", "My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.": "impressed", "Wow!  It sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted!  You must be really proud of him!": "proud", "I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!": "impressed", "Man, that is amazing that both your kids are so talented.  I hope my little ones are like that.  Congrats on your great parenting!": "proud", "Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.": "hopeful", "Are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it?": "prepared", "I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.": "apprehensive", "Well hopefully you're able to familiarize yourself quickly. Good luck!": "afraid", "I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.": "sad", "Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?": "sad", "Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.": "terrified", "Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?": "sad", "Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!": "surprised", "96! Wow. Thats a full life!": "content", "She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!": "sad", "Wow. She probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.": "furious", "I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before": "excited", "Excellent! Are you enjoying it?": "excited", "I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.": "prepared", "Sick. I hope it's as fun as it looks!": "anticipating", "My father passed away 2 years ago, but my mother lives in my neighborhood now. I'm so thankful she lives close by and still here with us. She's such a wonderful mother.": "grateful", "I am glad that she is living close to you. That must make you feel special. My mom is dead so I understand how you feel.": "caring", "I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.": "caring", "I am happy that your mom is still around. Cherish the days that you spend together.": "grateful", "I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!": "content", "are they typically bad or something?": "annoyed", "The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...": "annoyed", "Oh that makes sense, well enjoy the peace and quiet!": "content", "Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!": "content", "My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it": "surprised", "Thats awesome. What did you guys do?": "surprised", "We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor": "nostalgic", "that sounds fun!": "excited", "I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.": "caring", "Poor thing! What did you do?   Did you take it home with you?": "disgusted", "We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!": "proud", "eww,  that is great you took such great care of him.  ": "caring", "I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself": "caring", "That 's nice of you.  Did you keep it as a pet": "caring", "I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree": "terrified", "Cool.  Some birds shouldn't be in captivity.  What kind of bird was it": "caring", "Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving": "hopeful", "That is a nerve-racking experience. But I'm betting you did graduate and did just fine!": "anxious", "Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out": "disappointed", "Congratulations! Waiting for results can be very stressful - everything's out of your hands and all you can do is wait.": "anticipating", "I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!": "guilty", "I'm sure she understands, just tell the truth!": "ashamed", "I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :( ": "ashamed", "Yeah, I'd be pretty scared too, but it's better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest": "afraid", "You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???": "terrified", "I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment": "embarrassed", "Oh boy. Did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?": "embarrassed", "I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret": "embarrassed", "Everyone looks good in a dress. Just make sure to shave first.": "confident", "I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams": "terrified", "Oh man, I did too.  I still do every once in a while but only when I'm having trouble sleeping.  Does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly?": "embarrassed", "Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird": "embarrassed", "Creepy! I once had a dream of a Lion laying at the end of my bad. It was scary but also comforting.  I feel like I could've touched it. Glad you're free of those dreams now.": "terrified", "I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards": "embarrassed", "So you probably felt pretty guilty huh. Did you return what you stole?": "guilty", "No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that": "afraid", "Glad to hear you stopped with your wayward habits before the Po Po caught up with you!": "guilty", "I was at a meditation retreat last year for 10 days and I can say that I experienced a better feeling there than I could ever remembe": "apprehensive", "I've always liked the idea of meditation, but I feel like it'd be hard. My mind is always racing!": "afraid", "Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)": "annoyed", "Awesome, I'll check that out! I hear all sorts of great things about meditation.": "excited", "I am really looking forward to going away for the holidays.": "anticipating", "Me too, do you have any special plans?": "excited", "I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.": "excited", "How fun! yes I am sure they will have  a great time!": "excited", "They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!": "impressed", "I'm really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon.": "hopeful", "Is it for college?": "proud", "Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.": "confident", "Well good luck, I hope you get in!": "confident", "Thank you, fingers are crossed.": "hopeful", "I just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival.
