{"Yeah about 10 years ago I had a horrifying experience. It was 100% their fault but they hit the water barrels and survived. They had no injuries but they almost ran me off the road.": "disgusted", "Did you suffer any injuries?": "sadness", "No I wasn't hit. It turned out they were drunk. I felt guilty but realized it was his fault.": "sadness", "Why did you feel guilty? People really shouldn't drive drunk.": "sadness", "I don't know I was new to driving and hadn't experienced anything like that. I felt like my horn made him swerve into the water barrels.": "anger", "Well, can you tell me about your experience? I think we swapped places": "fear", "Yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience": "sadness", "Oh my goodness, that's very scary! I hope you are okay now and the drunk driver was punished for his actions?": "fear", "Yeah he was punished hes in jail still": "anger", "I there, dont know what to do, jst broke up with my girlfirned, we were 8 years together": "sadness", "sorry to hear! do you have any idea about the break up? did you think about it ?": "sadness", "Yes we decided together with our minds, and know i come home and feel so distant from the world": "sadness", "sorry again! hope you'll get relief from this sadness. Please concentrate on your interests to divert your mind from this.": "sadness", "I couldn't wait to go to the concert.": "joy", "Which Concert?": "fear", "The U2 concert. Tickets were really expensive and I never thought we would be able to go, but somehow we did!!!": "surprise", "Wow, that's awesome! I have never been to an actual concert.": "surprise", "I'm so sad because i've read an article about a newborn girl who died because her parents didn't believe in medication and doctors": "sadness", "Ugh, those articles always get me too... :( What was wrong with her? ": "anger", "she was born premature at home, she had hard time breathing on her own but instead of taking her to the doctor parents were just praying": "trust", "Jeez! Its so unfortunate... very sad really. ": "sadness", "yes! And i do believe in God and prayers but goodness gracious please take your children to the hospital and let God heal them THROUGH doctors": "trust", "so my friend's baby fell down and scraped his knee yesterday and i was trying so hard to cheer him up": "trust", "That is nice of you. What did you do?": "joy", "i was singing nursery songs :)": "joy", "Which one?": "joy", "\"If you happy and you know it\" :)": "joy", "my husband lost a job but i'm hoping he can find a full time job soon": "anticipation", "He will, I have faith.": "trust", "thank you so much!": "joy", "No problem. What kind of work does he do?": "anger", "he is an armed guard": "surprise", "i just moved to this neighborhood and some dumb criminals shot one of my neighbors and ran into the woods! ": "fear", "Thats not good. Do you own a gun?": "fear", "I do! I want to be able to protect my son": "trust", "That is always number one goal.": "sadness", "i'm so excited because i'm finally going to visit my parents next month! I didn't see them for 3 years": "joy", "3 years is a long time. How come?": "joy", "I moved to the US and they stayed in my homecountry": "joy", "Oh I see. They must miss you, too.": "sadness", "I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident": "anger", "That isn't very nice.": "sadness", "Yeah he got caught in someones pics on Facebook. Never lie and then go out with people who like to take pictures.": "sadness", "Yes. I do not have a Facebook.": "sadness", "Good idea. i don't like social media that much. It can get you in to trouble fast, even when expressing your opinions.": "anger", "So yeah i drove 2 hours to get to wallmart. with 299 in my wallet as advertised, and the real price of the tv was 399 usd. what a bummer": "sadness", "Thats horrible.": "sadness", "Yeah i had my hopes reall high and then i left empty handed, such a terrible feeling!": "sadness", "Yes I do not like walmart.": "sadness", "Yes, i guess walmart and the rest of false advertisement in the US, the look in my daugther eyes when i came home empty handed": "anger", "My friend's boyfriend recently made a pass at me. I'm married, and I also am really good friend's with his girlfriend so I felt really bad. I made sure he knew I was loyal and honest to both!": "trust", "Thats horrible. Did you tell on him?": "sadness", "I struggled with it, but my friend was in a really bad spot, with no income and raising her grandchild, he was the financial supporter. So, I didn't tell her, as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways, plus she really loves him!": "trust", "Thats a tough situation.": "anger", "my baby is sleeping. it's so peaceful and quiet in this house": "joy", "I guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted, lol. But it doesn't last forever and is worth it. ": "sadness", "i totally agree with you!": "joy", "That's a full time job raising a human": "joy", "hi, i feel so lonely sometimes because all my friends live in a different country": "sadness", "Oh, I'm sure you are lonely. Maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends?": "sadness", "i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms": "sadness", "That's a good idea! This way you can also meet friends for yourself, but also maybe meet new friend's for your children to hang out with while you do with their moms!": "sadness", "I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home, he grabbed a game and sat on it, instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me, especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.": "anger", "oh man. i'm all about discipline! I don't like spoiled bratty kids": "sadness", "Me either! I have two of my own children, and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!": "sadness", "yes, i've heard some parents don't ever say no to their kids. makes no sense": "sadness", "I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died": "fear", "ok": "sadness", "Ugh I hate bugs with a passion, they are so creepy": "fear", "I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well, and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.": "trust", "Did things end amicably? I hope everything is good now!": "joy", "Yes, they ended somewhat well, but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well, but I miss her.": "sadness", "I understand that, I hope things work out well for you both in the end!": "sadness", "Thank you! That means a lot.": "sadness", "One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.": "joy", "That is a very blessed day. It is something you will never forget.": "joy", "Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for, and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.": "sadness", "Yes, I couldn't agree more. It is remarkable how your feeling suddenly change.": "surprise", "Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!": "trust", "I bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened.": "fear", "Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.": "anticipation", "Oh I'm sure. I would not like to be in a situation like that. Good thing everything worked out for you.": "trust", "Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend": "trust", "Oh really? What happened with your family and friend then?": "sadness", "My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be ": "trust", "Oh wow, that's awful. Stuff like that really teaches you to appreciate what you've got and to not take it for granted.": "trust", "Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you": "trust", "I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me, but it always seems to be spot on.": "surprise", "I agree, someimes we just know": "anger", "It is a \"knowing\" -- and a flowing! When something is right, it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led, even if you might not fully know to where.": "joy", "exactly, i get that entirely!": "sadness", "I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best! ": "joy", "That's great! How did they surprise you?": "surprise", "I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there": "sadness", "That is so sweet of them, I hope you enjoyed it!": "surprise", "I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely": "sadness", "Awww, That sucks man. Hopefully they don't say mean things to you about being lonely.": "sadness", "Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes": "sadness", "Well i used to be lonely a lot but i eventually found someone. I think you will too.": "sadness", "As silly as it sounds, I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.": "sadness", "Yeah that is always odd to me, before they can talk they are already unique!": "anger", "One was pacifier, one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep, one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier, one liked cocooning in a sling!": "surprise", "That is how it goes, sometimes you can just figure them out immediately": "sadness", "The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.": "sadness", "I understand that one,they are my favorite place to eat": "anger", "Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.": "sadness", "That has happened to me too many times to count": "sadness", "I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family": "trust", "That must have been and intense and emotional moment for you.": "sadness", "Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him ": "sadness", "Uau, what a surreal moment.I always believe kids have a lot to teach us.": "trust", "My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older, it will get better!": "sadness", "I'm sure it will! I didn't get along with my dad until i became an adult.": "sadness", "That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh, my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?": "sadness", "Yes it did. I believe she just waited it out and tried to neutralize the conversation when we were together. ": "sadness", "But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!": "trust", "I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others, but that doesn't make me feel any better.": "sadness", "Where you not secure in your self?": "fear", "Well, like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately, she was. As an adult of course, my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!": "sadness", "You can track her down to say sorry, or would that be creepy?": "fear", "Unfortunately, she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out, and her brother and I \"friended\" one another.": "sadness", "Wow, so your going to take being a bad person to the grave. Maybe you'll see her in the next life?": "sadness", "I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.": "surprise", "Lucky you! That is rare. Maybe one day people will think of you like that?": "joy", "That's a very kind statement, and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm, not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?": "surprise", "I have something totally different. My boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader. ": "surprise", "That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself, and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?": "joy", "Well I've been in the business all my life and have worked for some great people. So I pull from what I learned from them.": "joy", "My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!": "surprise", "It's crazy how quickly kiddos grow! Even in a few weeks time! Do you see your friend and her baby often?": "surprise", "It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often, even though we live 30 minutes away.": "sadness", "That is how life goes! Different schedules and demands -- I'm sure she's so thrilled when she *does* get to see you!": "joy", "Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!": "trust", "Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!": "joy", "Wow, that is an amazing accomplishment!  Congratulations!  You gotta be feeling like you're on top of the world after that!": "joy", "Ah, it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!": "trust", "My first thought was \"California\" but then there's Venice [Italy] and then either way, that's an amazing destination!": "joy", "We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-)": "surprise", "Oh, wow.  Not only to be able to do all the running but to view the scenery!": "joy", "I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.": "surprise", "I'm sorry to hear that! How did you find out? ": "sadness", "She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.": "sadness", "That's a real bummer, but as they say, there are plenty of fish in the sea!": "sadness", "I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.": "disgusted", "I feel the same way.": "sadness", "How do you channel the anger? Obviously, it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!": "anger", "I practice boxing. I love to punch the sandbags.It is very therapeutic.": "joy", "Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!)": "anger", "One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.": "sadness", "Oh no that is terrible!  How did your daughter take it?": "sadness", "She was around 11, so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school, as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.": "sadness", "Oh poor thing.  I hope she is doing better now.  Losing a pet is extremely hard!": "sadness", "I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!": "joy", "ooo they are gonna love it, just its expensive, I remember when it was only $20 to get in.": "sadness", "Same! I was excited because I grew up going there. My grandparents lived in Tucson, and we would spend the summers with them -- the most exciting part being our drive to Disneyland each year!": "joy", "Which one are you going to California or Florida ?": "joy", "California! Old school ;-) They've kept so much of the original, while adding lots of new attractions.": "sadness", "I recently spoke to my father for the first time in years. It reminded me of my childhood and the distant past.": "sadness", "Cool.  Somethings never change.  What did you reflect upon?": "sadness", "We spoke about our recent lives. Apparently he is in the market for a new car.": "anger", "Yeah, I miss my dad.  He died several years ago.  What kind of car is he looking for?": "sadness", "Do you like to organize your house.  My mother-in-law recently surprised me recently with some organizing stuff b/c she knows how much I love it!": "surprise", "I'm trying to get into it. we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything. Do you have tips? ": "joy", "Labels and Bins can be your best friend!  Especially with a new baby.  ": "surprise", "My big thing is i'm like O' I may need that leave it out of the tote box. Before I know it I have more stuff laying around then when I started.": "joy", "I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.": "sadness", "Well, sometimes people are busy and don't have the time to check emails": "sadness", "It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation, how do you ensure communication?": "sadness", "Text and emails are still the best option., until a nw way is created.": "sadness", "I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.": "anger", "Isn't that what sisters are for?  What were you guys upset about?": "anger", "I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.": "sadness", "Maybe once you feel like you can bring it up again, you can try to approach the topic from another angle.": "anger", "I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas, my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!": "sadness", "Congratulations! Where did you travel from and where did you end up?": "joy", "From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!": "joy", "That must have been quite the culture shock, glad it all worked out though!": "surprise", "One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.": "sadness", "I know, that actually happens to me sometimes! Last year I didn't get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks I was underestimating myself a lot.": "sadness", "That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person, though, that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.": "trust", "Yea for sure, I definitely learned that sometimes life just works in a funny way. When's the last time you have been really disappointed? ": "sadness", "Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.": "sadness", "I totally understand why he was mad. Why did you tell her?": "anger", "Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess": "sadness", "I guess he wanted to be available if she needed him.": "sadness", "There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time, simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!": "anger", "What is a back neighbor? And that is crazy!": "anger", "Yes, she lived several house back and she didn't know me, until after she did that! She knew me then, but after I talked to her, she apologized to both of us. ": "sadness", "Oh my! I'm glad she apologized!": "sadness", "Too often, it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.": "joy", "I understand. I am think the same thing. What is your health issue?": "fear", "Happily, I don't have one! It's more seeing family and friends and the situations they're in. Not everything can be helped -- but there are some things we can all do to take care of ourselves, you know?": "trust", "Yes, we should try to yourself heathy": "joy", "Every time I look through older photos of my children, I'm taken right back to the time they were that size, and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling, for sure.": "sadness", "Oh, it sure is, I feel the same way. They grow up so fast! ": "sadness", "Are your kids adults now?": "sadness", "One of them is! I have an 18 year old and a 12 year old.": "sadness", "I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you, but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!": "sadness", "I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!": "joy", "I bet you were beautiful on that day. :) I hope that confidence has carried on since then!": "joy", "I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.": "sadness", "It would be hard to replicate that day for sure, but I bet you have a lot to be confident about. You got this!": "joy", "My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times, since it can be tough to determine a \"regular\" income.": "trust", "I bet it's tough. A regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better. ": "joy", "We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed, right there.": "joy", "Your so lucky. Insurance is my number one worry every month. ": "trust", "I am sorry, because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.": "sadness", "I met up with an old flame recently, didn't go how I expected": "sadness", "Oh ya? What happened?? I'm intrigued": "fear", "Well, right after she gave me a big hug, she introduced me to her new boyfriend.": "sadness", "Woah plot twist. She brought him along to meet you? ": "fear", "I know right! No warning or anything. He turned out to be a nice guy, but I thought it was a little misleading on her part.": "anger", "My family and I are going on vacation in a few weeks. We rented a largo beachfront condo and I can't wait!": "joy", "OH I love the beach!!  Which beach are you going to go to?": "joy", "We are going to be staying at Miramar Beach in Florida, about an  hour Panama City Beach. The view is amazing from our balcony and we are so ready!": "joy", "PCB is where we always go! If you want to drive a little bit, go to HUNTS in PCB - it's off the beaten path but THE best seafood and prices - just go early (like 4oclock) for dinner or you won't get in!!": "anger", "I was supposed to go for brunch with my friend Maria the other day. At least that was the plan.": "sadness", "Why didn't you go?": "sadness", "Well, we had initially agreed to meet at 11. Wouldn't you know it, she didn't end up returning my text until 3PM!": "sadness", "Is she always a flake? Maybe time for a new friend?": "sadness", "Me and my mom were at this grocery store recently and this guy started following us outside the store and then again inside the store it was so scary!": "fear", "Did he do anything to you and your mom?": "sadness", "Well I knew he was following us and so I asked the manager to walk us out to the car and when he did we saw the guy come out again from between the two buildings b/c he was waiting on us.  so scary!": "fear", "I am glad that nothing happened.": "fear", "Did I tell you what happened with Li the other night? Boy do I feel dumb.": "sadness", "No, you didn't tell me! What happened?": "sadness", "She's 45 minutes late to our anniversary dinner. I don't know what happened to me but I called and left an angry message. Turns out, she had gotten T-boned at an intersection and was talking to the Police Officer when I called!": "anger", "Oh no! Is she okay?! Don't beat yourself up too much, you couldn't have ever imagined that she had been in an accident.": "sadness", "Ugh! I looked like such a fool at my girlfriend's work party! ": "anger", "What happened?": "sadness", "Well, I ended up having way too much to drink. One of her co-workers had a bottle of Fireball (gross I KNOW) and was making everybody do shots. I didn't want to look foolish, so I had... well too many.": "disgusted", "I love Fireball.": "sadness", "Did I tell you what happened with the concert I was supposed to go to Saturday?": "anger", "No, what happened?": "sadness", "Well first of all, it wasn't just any concert - it was Jay-Z and Beyonce! AND IT GOT RAINED OUT! ": "sadness", "Thats horrible. Will they reschedule?": "anger", "You are never going to guess who was sleeping on the couch when I got home from New York...": "fear", "Who, tell me!": "joy", "My friend Benny! The one we all thought died in a monsoon in Thailand!": "fear", "Wow, what happened?": "sadness", "Recently, my husband came home from grocery shopping and had gifts for me for Mother's Day. He had a beautiful diamond ring and other lovely gifts, it was very unexpected!": "surprise", "That is very nice gift. Did you bought anything for him for Father's day?": "surprise", "I did! I also gave him unexpected gifts and he was super happy. I was very touched by him being so thoughtful!": "surprise", "That is great.": "joy", "I know I shouldn't count my chicks before they hatch, but I'm feeling pretty good after that interview today!": "joy", "Oh what job was the interview for?": "joy", "This advertising company! The owner was there - you should have seen his face. My last freelance project was a real winner. Think I got it?": "surprise", "I think you got it man! Congratz!": "joy", "Did I ever tell you about the time I \"got taken hostage\"?": "fear", "oh my  are you really serious?": "sadness", "As a heart attack. It was me and Big C at the World's Largest Pistachio. All of the sudden we hear gunshots, and DiDi's still in the car. We ran in the building, and he comes flying in after us. He never pointed the gun at us, and we ended up running away when he was distracted. It's too crazy - I can't make this up. Just glad to be alive!": "sadness", "I am very glad it has a happy ending. Sounds a bit scary": "trust", "I went to visit a friend one day and her boyfriend made a pass at me. He actually suddenly kissed me, as I was waiting for my friend to return. I couldn't believe his nerve!": "surprise", "Oh no, what did you do?": "sadness", "I quietly pushed him away, as I didn't want my friend to hear. I was so shocked and upset, since he knew I wouldn't want to make a scene and took advantage.": "surprise", "Did you ever tell your friend?  ": "sadness", "This past Friday night our refrigerator stopped cooling! We had to go the weekend without it, and of course had to deal with some unpleasant smells and throw away a large amount of food! It wasn't a fun weekend for us!": "disgusted", "Oh no, I hate when that happens. I can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice! Its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer": "sadness", "Yes, and of course we tried to call and have someone come out, but to no avail! You don't realize how much you rely on things like that until they aren't working!": "trust", "I wish refrigerators would have a warranty that replaced food when they went bad. ": "disgusted", "I felt pretty bad when I was having girl talk with my friend and we were talking about our partners. Her boyfriend had made a pass at me, but I never told her about it. ": "sadness", "Wao, you must fell weird about it! what you thinki to do about it?": "sadness", "I felt bad, but she wasn't working and taking care of her grandchild, and her boyfriend was the financial support. I knew it would really be hard on her if she found out, not to mention she really loves him.": "trust", "SUper tough situation, i think you should let her know, and let her decides next": "anger", "I was at the mall and hug my mom and said to her: Time to go Mommy! and i wasnt her, can you imagine my reaction to it?": "sadness", "Oh, I'm sure you were embarrassed! But, maybe you can laugh about it now?": "sadness", "Yes, totally but at the moment i felt like the stupidiest person on earth, didn't know were to hide! and my mom was watching": "sadness", "Well, I'm sure mom had a laugh lol! I can imagine how you felt at the time though!": "sadness", "THe good thing about it, was the lady, she was laughing and later told me that it has happened to her childrens to, no worries!": "sadness", "I am looking forward to going on vacation in a few weeks! We have a condo reserved on the beach, with fantastic ocean views. I'm ready!": "joy", "Ah, that sounds fantastic! Which ocean will you be enjoying?": "joy", "Well, we are staying at Panama City Beach, so we're right there at the Gulf of Mexico.": "joy", "Sounds awesome! Do you have a beachside beverage or traditions that you enjoy? (Mine would be tequila + lime...very Jimmy Buffett ;-))": "joy", "I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer, and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!": "joy", "Well, that's impressive! I can see why you are proud. Sounds like a hard working young lady!": "joy", "That, and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-))": "trust", "Yes, I was the same way too! I started working two days after I turned 16 so I could have my own money too!": "trust", "Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.": "surprise", "Okay, a silly pet peeve but one nonetheless -- when people just leave their grocery carts willy-nilly in the parking lot. No consideration for others or the people who work at the store!": "anger", "Absolutely I agree I always try to not even bring cart unless I have too many too carry.": "joy", "Me too. And I will always make sure to at *least* put it in one of those cart corrals, if not walk it back up to the store. Hey -- extra exercise ;-)": "sadness", "Yes me too Now if everyone would just take our lead lol": "sadness", "WE CAN SAVE THE WOOOOOOORLD!!!!! (lol indeed....!)": "sadness", "I came home, and my wife showed me a picture in 4d of our future baby, my heart speeded so fast!": "sadness", "oh wow. Do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet?": "joy", "We choose to wait! but the amount of happiness in my body is tremendous! never felt this way before.": "joy", "First time parent?": "sadness", "Yes, God willing the baby is going to be healthy in every way! can wait to ave the second": "joy", "I love being in the \"flow\" -- whether it's in speaking to a group of people or working to help facilitate meetings.": "joy", "What kind of work do you do?": "joy", "I work with different organizations on strengthening their culture, and I do large-scale visual notetaking (also known as graphic recording). Are you familiar with that at all? (Not unusual NOT to be!)": "surprise", "Actually I'm not, but it sounds very interesting and by working with different organizations, I would imagine it's also exciting and new every day.": "joy", "That's one of the huge benefits -- learning about many different industries and subjects!": "joy", "I LOVE when leaders know that it actually *helps* them to be surrounded by strong people -- people they can learn from, that challenge them, and that in some ways could be considered \"better\".": "sadness", "I agree, its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas": "joy", "It's just too many leaders want \"yes men\" and/or people who feel non-threatening. It's a trap and a quick path to mediocrity, if not failure!": "fear", "Yes men are definitely a bad idea when it comes to life and business": "sadness", "I'll always remember the day I learned I was pregnant with our first child -- Halloween in Chicago, and we were with friends at the Shedd Aquarium! I've loved baby belugas since ;-)": "joy", "Baby belugas are cute, but not as cute as your baby!": "joy", "Ha! True that ;-) That's also the year that A Bug's Life came out, and we always thought of our young one as \"Dot\", the spunky little girl ant in the movie.": "surprise", "That is so funny! I don't think she'll want to be compared to an ant when she gets older. You'll have to remind her.": "sadness", "This mother's day was amazing! I got so much more than expected and it was all so heartfelt": "sadness", "That is great!!  Sometimes we mom's get a bit forgotten, so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling.": "joy", "Yes, definitely! I actually cried a few times because of how much thought went into each gift and what was written in the cards ": "surprise", "Those words are the things we cherish more than any other thing, I love it when my girls do that!": "joy", "THat's too bad. What do you think went wrong?": "sadness", "I am not sure, it was pretty random": "fear", "Did they give you any feedback?": "anger", "No, nothing at all": "sadness", "That is a shame, you need to learn from your mistakes.": "sadness", "I know": "sadness", "So my sister told us a couple weeks ago she was pregnant. Her and her husband are so excited. I hope they have an amazing 9 months and then an amazing time raising the baby.": "surprise", "That is exciting news!  I bet you were so surprised!": "joy", "I was very surprised. She didn't tell a single person they were trying for a baby. Just announced it on the 4th of July": "surprise", "Ha!  What a neat day to announce it - did they do any special kind of announcement?  I see so many videos of interesting and neat ways to make that announcement.": "anticipation", "Yes, they put a picture of their sonogram on the tv and waited for someone to notice it. So exciting": "sadness", "Oh no, what did you do instead? Did you watch Netflix?": "sadness", "I do watch Netflix sometimes.  Do you watch?": "sadness", "Yes, I do. I recently watched the series \"Dark.\" It's the German one.": "fear", "I haven't heard of that one.  What genre does it fall in?": "joy", "It's a supernatural mystery type. I won't spoil the twist.": "surprise", "Sounds interesting!": "joy", "It was fantastic, a lot of people have been comparing it to Stranger Things, but its a lot more grime and serious.": "joy", "I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer, and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.": "joy", "Did it go your way?": "fear", "Yes, I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.": "surprise", "That is great - have you found another job yet?": "joy", " Yes I am currently working as a processing assistant at a warehouse. I love it. Much better than my last job": "joy", "Today traffic was horrible and was so frustrating!": "anger", "I hate traffic too, it makes me angry": "anger", "Yes! People were constantly cutting me off,not signalling and slamming on their brakes": "anger", "People are so rude when they drive these days": "anger", "The grudge scared me when I was 10 to which I couldn't navigate my own house.": "fear", "I can imagine! That was a terrifying movie.": "fear", "And yet I still felt as if I had to see the sequels when they came out too.": "sadness", "That happened to me too.. with the other Exorcist movies and the Ring movies. Even though they scared me, I was too curious to not see the others.": "fear", "My best friend did amazing in school, despite having 2 children and not doing great academically in school. She ended up getting honors in her first 2 semesters.": "surprise", "She sounds like a person with great ability. Great choice of friend.": "trust", "She has been my friend for 19 years. She pushes me to do better too.": "anger", "That's great. I wish I had someone so close like that!": "trust", "I hope you find someone like that. I believe everyone needs and deserves friends like that.": "sadness", "Today when I went outside to check my new banana plant I noticed the new leaf was turning brown.": "disgusted", "Is that a bad sign? Perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight?": "anticipation", "I don't think that's the problem. I am worried about a drainage issue. I'm going to check back in a couple days.": "fear", "Oh, I see. I am not much of a horticulturist but it makes sense that it could be over-saturated.": "disgusted", "I'm new to growing bananas and from what I understand they can be very sensitive to over-watering. It was doing great before today. Possibly wind too. ": "joy", "I decided a few months I was ready for a puppy, so I put the word out": "joy", "Put what word ? You mean published the info?": "joy", "Basically, yes. I made a classified ad. I was beyond thrilled after getting a call to get one!": "joy", "So what breed did you get ?": "joy", "When I bought my first house I put down 20% of the loan, which made me broke quick. My monthly paycheck helped me with bills but my parents bought me groceries for a month until I got on my feet. SO grateful for them": "trust", "I would be too! You did what you had to do!": "sadness", "Yes, I am always better off with them as my parents, they want to see us succeed": "joy", "Do you find the home buying experience worth it?": "joy", "Yes, it was well worth it! I love being independant. teaches you a lot.": "joy", "How long do you plan on staying in that house?": "joy", "Maybe 5 more years then I am ready for something bigger. Probably when I get married": "joy", "Well that's awesome! I'm happy for you!": "joy", "My friend is a surgeon and we were discussing salary. He easily makes 200,000 a year and he is only 32. It's crazy and I was jealous of him.": "anger", "You shouldn't, because that is  a very stressful job": "sadness", "Yeah, that's a good point. I also realized he has a high malpractice insurance, and is on call a lot.": "sadness", "And don't forget how many years they have to study in order to get a license for surgery": "anticipation", "True. He went to college for 12 years! The student loans are probably high too.": "joy", "I am in college and I was talking to my student adviser the other day about the future": "joy", "Really? Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? I know sometimes it's tough to settle on a path.": "sadness", "I want to be one to run the office part of a physicians practice but that isn't set in stone. I am thrilled to start my new career path": "joy", "That sounds like a great career plan. You will be filling a very important role in the physician's practice!": "joy", "That is disgusting! What can you do about about it?": "disgusted", "I'm not sure. What would you do?": "sadness", "You could chat to them and complain!": "anger", "Maybe I will try that. Do you think it will work?": "sadness", "Who knows, I guess it depends on how reasonable they are. ": "trust", "One time when I was kicked out of the place I was staying at, my best friend immediately told me I could stay with her until I got on my feet.": "trust", "Oh no, that sounds like an awful situation. What did you end up doing after that?": "anger", "I stayed with her for about a year until I got my own apartment. We are getting an apartment together in a few months.": "joy", "So exciting! It can be fun to have a roommate": "joy", "She also has 2 daughters, 2 and 7, and a few crested geckos too so I'll have a bunch of roommates.": "sadness", "I love that. Lots of new friends, haha": "joy", "I've known them since the moment they were born, but it will still be a blast.": "trust", "Last week when Toys R Us closed it really made me start thinking of the 90s and my childhood": "sadness", "I've heard a lot of people say something similar. Did you go there a lot?": "sadness", "I did! I was talking to my husband about the different toys I had. Even started talking about the music and shows from that era": "sadness", "Where I grew up didn't have one nearby so I get a little jealous hearing about it.": "anger", "The other day I came across a Facebook post showing all the old stuff from the 90's.. it took me way back to my childhood.": "sadness", "Good lord you must have had Facebook for a LONG time! I started mine in college so there isn't anything from my younger years.": "sadness", "Oh no, it was just a post someone shared that covered all the old trends, food, toys, tv shows, etc. I had Facebook back in 2010 but not earlier than that.": "sadness", "Oh ok lol. I completely understand. I had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player. Totally remember doing that!": "sadness", "How old are you? Were you a child in the 80s? I am 30 so I grew up during the 90s.": "sadness", "I am 33 :)": "surprise", "Oh so only a few years older than me. I love the feeling of nostalgia though. I pretty much live for it.": "sadness", "I hate bullies. Playground or politics, I find them intolerable.": "anger", "Me too, bullies are part of the reason that I homeschooled.": "fear", "Good for you! Did you find other ways to interact with kids on better terms?": "trust", "Well, I was referring to my own kids. They have adjusted well at 17 and 19.": "sadness", "I expected the new incredibles to be pretty bad but to my pleasure it came out good.": "surprise", "I also saw it and felt like it was pretty good. Much better than the My Little Pony Movie. That was TORTURE.": "joy", "Oh I can't imagine. I don't think I would pay more than a quarter to see that movie.": "fear", "Yeah it was so boring. Even my kids got bored and they had been dying to see it,": "sadness", "My parents keep taking my money": "anger", "That's not nice of them. Why do they keep taking it??": "anger", "They need it for other stuff. I never get a chance to save any of it.": "sadness", "Sorry to hear that. I found that it helps to have multiple savings accounts, so whenever you get a certain amount of money (like $5, $10) save it and be strict not to spend it.": "joy", "So when adults don't clean up after themselves in a business environment -- what is that ?! Why do they think a \"mommy\" will come along to clean up after them?!": "anger", "LOL! This is perfect timing because I had the \" You are an adult not a child\" conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago. I had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky. I argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat Popsicles in bed, then you have to deal with the consequences. ": "anger", "LOL! Okay, y'all are a sitcom. I have to ask what flavor. (And yes, I side with your girlfriend. If for no other reason: ANTS. You do NOT want ants marching into your bed toward any potentially sensitive regions. Okuuurrrrrr?)": "fear", "Okay, it wasn't just one, it was three: One cherry, and two grape. How anyone can eat just one at a time? Oh, the number of wrappers was also brought up. Like, I don't care if yuo bought them for the kids, I am part of this household as well. I tried to make it a teaching moment about how if you don't get the popsicles first someone else would, but I think my arguments have been falling on deaf ears for awhile now, lol": "sadness", "The hardest time in my life was when my best friend died on Christmas of 2007.": "sadness", "Wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. That would be incredibly hard. What happened?": "sadness", "She fell off of a roof. She fell asleep and when she got up, she slipped.": "sadness", "That's horrible. I'm really sorry about your friend. ": "sadness", "It has been a long time so I have come to cope with it, but sometimes it's still hard. I named my daughter after her. Her name is Roxie.": "sadness", "That's a beautiful name! It's cool you honored your friend in that way. ": "sadness", "It really helped me heal when I was able to do that.": "trust", "I can't even imagine. I've never lost anyone super close to me yet...": "sadness", "A few years ago, there was a time that I really needed a car. I had to go to school and my husband worked full time. ": "trust", "Did you not have a car? That's hard. I don't have one now and use Uber and Lyft all the time.": "anger", "We had one car we shared but I had a little girl and we were just stuck at the house or got rides. We didn't really have uber and Lydt yet. But someone gave me a car out of the blue!": "fear", "That is incredible! I swear some things in life are determined by fate. I'm glad you were able to get a car.": "joy", "Thanks me too. It blew me away that people can be so kind. ": "sadness", "It's incredible, and so important. That's why I try to pass on the kindness whenever I am able.": "trust", "Have you ever had a surprise birthday party planned for you? I did a few years back.": "surprise", "Yes.My first was when i turned 18.": "joy", "That's awesome! What a good year to do it. I remember begging my husband to throw me one every year. ": "trust", "LOL.You had to beg your husband for a surprise party??": "surprise", "Haha! Yes! And what's really funny, is that I almost missed it because I wasn't actually expecting it and almost didn't get back in time! Whoops. ": "sadness", "It was raining hard one night and the power shut off": "fear", "Did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see?": "sadness", "Only lighters. Now we are stocked on candles ": "joy", "Well atleast you have something to help you guys.": "sadness", "One time I studied my butt off for my first psychology exam. It was hard and I studied all night.": "joy", "How did you do": "joy", "I ended up actually getting a 98%!": "joy", "That is great! My B.S. ( I always hate saying that because I have to say I have my BS in psychology) is in Psychology.": "joy", "Haha I always thought that was a funny term too. That's amazing. Psychology is absolutely fascinating.": "joy", "Do you have any pets?": "sadness", "Pet? Like dogs and other?": "anger", "Yes. We got a cat not too long  ago and he drives me crazy! He's such a night owl and is always banging into stuff. ": "fear", "Wow, seriously I hate those pets being around me": "sadness", "My son graduated. ": "joy", "From where?": "sadness", "Highschool.": "joy", "Congrats ,that's a step forward": "joy", "One of the hardest times in my life was when I had to leave my husband and daughter when I went through a divorce.": "sadness", "I am so sorry. I can't imagine what you must have went through.": "sadness", "I felt like I had no one. The two people I loved most in life I barely saw and was disconnected from.": "sadness", "That must have been really hard. ": "sadness", "It was, but I grew so much from it, and it ended up being the very best thing that could have happened to me.": "sadness", "I know this guy who is so young, yet he owns his own major business. It's really impressive.": "surprise", "Really?  What kind of work does he do?": "joy", "He owns his own coffee shop. He started roasting when he was 16 and now he's only 26 but distributes beans across the country.": "surprise", "Wow.. that is impressive.  Are you guys still friends?  Maybe he could get you a job in one of his stores.": "surprise", "I feel slightly bad. I think I hurt my mom's feelings last week because she told me about a necklace I got rid of when I was a kid. She's a packrat and I'm really, really not.": "sadness", "Awww... reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that.  What was the necklace all about did you make it or something?": "sadness", "I feel like her and my aunt kind of could be on that show. :/ I'm all about less stuff to pick up! lol Eh..it was a necklace she gave me when they found out they were pregnant. It said \"Special Sister\". I'm probably a jerk..": "sadness", "Well why did you have it if it belonged to them?  Did you pawn it?": "surprise", "No, they bought it for me. I think I was going goodwill it and she grabbed it back. lol She said she wants to pass it onto my daughter someday so that's sweet.": "sadness", "Thats sweet of them. Maybe you could make it up to her buy getting her a special mom necklace with your spare cash.": "sadness", "Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?": "sadness", "All the time.  That is part of listening to music I suppose.  The songs remind you of when you first heard them.": "sadness", "Yeah, I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..": "sadness", "I know what you mean.  However, the older I get the more I want to go back LOL.": "sadness", "lol :) That's true. Life is hard and did seem so much more carefree when I was younger, but I just don't like who I was. I like me now much better :)": "sadness", "I was just thinking about how a few years ago, we lost our cat.": "sadness", "Oh no!  What happened to it?": "sadness", "It was the first time he had gotten outside and he didn't come back that night. He was hit by a car. :(": "sadness", "So sad!  I am sorry.  Don't feel too bad its natural for them to want to be outside.": "sadness", "Thank you. I appreciate that. ": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that. I had a dog die once too.": "sadness", "it is so sad to know but my mother is rather sick of flu and not dying ": "trust", "The flu sure makes it feel like you're dying haha": "sadness", "Oh yes but it is not as bad and you cannot call it dying like in Cancer patient ": "fear", "Agreed, definitely not. I actually work in radiation oncology and see cancer every day at work.": "trust", "Once I ate a raw oyster because my uncle offered me some and I contracted food poisoning. Things were coming out from both ends, so gross.": "disgusted", "Did you get sick afterwards ": "fear", "Extremely, but it passed after a day or so. Never consume raw shellfish, unless sushi because they properly prepare it": "disgusted", "i do not think sushi is that good too. The best option is to stop eating them in any form of food": "disgusted", "You don't care for sushi that much?": "fear", "I recently had a prank played on me. My friend pretended to be dead and used ketchup as a prop!": "sadness", "Damn that sounds like a pretty good one!

I don't know what to do with my life.": "sadness", "I am so sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you might be able to reconcile???": "trust", "I don't think so. He wants to join the military since his dad has passed away and I'm not sure if that's the lifestyle I want.": "sadness", "Oh that's too bad. ): I don't want to overstep but I always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up. ": "sadness", "I think we're going to try long distance while I finish up school (3 more years). But it's just scary thinking of it all.": "fear", "I think that's good! If you are meant to be together you'll feel it and it will work out I think, if you just keep your conviction and stick with it. Good luck with it! ": "joy", "We have dogs and chameleons together, so it's like we're already a little family haha": "joy", "Aw, that's sweet! I really am hoping y'all make it through this together. (:": "sadness", "I recently found out the girl I love may not feel the same way. This makes me sad.": "sadness", "So sad,you can never force someone to love you. You will find the right person for you.": "sadness", "I hope so. Maybe one day, but I am not so sure.": "sadness", "Don't give up on love.It the best feeling ever to experience. Wish you well.": "sadness", "I feel pretty hopeful towards this woman that I really enjoy. I am trying to date her.": "anticipation", "Do you have a good chance with her. Have you talked to her about it?": "anger", "I think she has expressed interest in me in the past, but she recently moved, but she is not too far away. I might ask her on a date the next time I am around.": "sadness", "That will be better. Talk to her before you lose her": "sadness", "I am very lucky, my friends are so great. What's the best birthday you have had?": "trust", "Probably one where I got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant, it was great. What about yours, what makes your friends so great too?": "surprise", "Wow, I am impressed! My friends just show me love and buy me tequila aha!": "surprise", "I wish my friends bought me alcohol, that would make for a hell of a night!

It made us both very annoyed.": "anger", "That must be hard I always wished I had a sister though I have a brother ": "anger", "I recently had a scary experience. I heard gunshots on my street.": "fear", "Oh my! You must have been terrified! Did everything turn out ok?": "fear", "Everything turned out fine.

That is a very scary situation.": "fear", "Do you know the feeling of drinking a mug of hot cocoa with marshmallows on a cold winter's night?": "joy", "I have not tried yet, but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight": "joy", "Next time you get a cold front in your area you should try it. It's extremely relaxing and sleep-inducing haha": "joy", "I live in a place where it only snows once in 10 years. So, i think i am passing on that": "joy", "I live in Louisiana, so it's very rare that I get to enjoy it. I've had it maybe three or four times in my lifetime. It just left a lasting impression.": "trust", "I love my mom. She does her best to provide for me, even to this day.": "trust", "You are so lucky. Mums are the best. What do you do for her?": "joy", "I tell her I love her and also send her gifts from time to time. She doesn't live too close to me but I try.": "trust", "You should spend time with her whilst you can. My mum died and I wish I had been with her more.": "trust", "You know, that is tough, but it happens to the best of us. What went wrong?": "sadness", "Nothing went wrong, we just have different lives in different places. I go visit every now and then.": "sadness", "But you failed the exam?

What do you do/": "joy", "well i am a mover so i have to bring heavy furniture up and down stairs.": "sadness", "That sounds like hard work.

": "fear", "That is such a bummer. Why did you keep watching them?": "sadness", "I honestly don't know. I've always been fascinated with them since being a little girl and that fascination has never gone away.": "surprise", "I understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing. Maybe you should stop watching as many though. ": "surprise", "I've been telling myself that for years, I just have no self control.

It makes me feel bad about life.": "sadness", "Oh yeah, Donald Trump is such a charlatan. He has some really shady history too. I'm actually a Christian and a conservative but I'm appalled that everyone on the \"right\" have fallen for this guy. He's so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be.": "anger", "I agree. I am glad real conservatives are in opposition to him, too.": "trust", "Yeah, I am sad about the whole left vs. right thing in general. Ultimately we should all be uniting against the corrupt people that are running amok in the government. ": "disgusted", "I am now going to be a master's student.

He is also very sweet and very respectful.": "trust", "I am happy for you wish I could find a nice lover like that.": "trust", "Do you like to go through old family pictures?": "sadness", "Yes, I think they offer a great bridge to the past. Do you?": "sadness", "Absolutely. I love to hear my m\u00e1m\u00e1 tell me stories from her childhood trapping nutria and trawling with her family.": "anger", "That's great.

I am trying to build the courage.": "anticipation", "I know it's hard to build the confidence needed to do something like that, but you don't want to keep them to yourself. If you really think she is the woman of your dreams then you have to try": "joy", "How long?": "joy", "I'm not quite following.

She ended up keeping me waiting inside 30 extra minutes! I was pretty frustrated.": "anger", "I can only imagine having to wait at the table alone, wondering if she'd show up. At least, it sounds like, she finally arrived.  Did she specify a reason for being so late?": "sadness", "Yes, she actually had a legit reason so I couldn't be too mad at her.. She definitely made it up to me!": "anger", "That's good. I can somewhat relate. I think the longest I've waited on someone was a colleague who was supposed to meet us at happy hour, and ended up getting delayed by our boss for 45 minutes. We were glad she made it out, but I did feel worse for her than for all of us.": "trust", "I'm just so happy it's finally Friday!": "joy", "Ahhh! Me too, there is so much that can be done on the weekends!": "joy", "i just want to sleep in and then watch movies all day long... but i'm a mom so i don't sleep in. ever": "fear", "I understand that! I have a bunch of pet snakes that wake me up thru the night!": "anger", "I had to cancel a trip to see my brother after it started snowing heavily.": "sadness", "Actually that has happened to me, during Thanksgiving": "anger", "Yes, when the snow builds up on the road I get nervous, and during this trip I couldn't even see where the road was and where the ditch began.": "fear", "Im from NC mountains, it can be tricking driving when the snow is latying fast": "joy", "It sure can.  When I decided that I wasn't comfortable driving in such deep snow I literally turned around and went home.": "joy", "That is a smart idea. Sometimes I would have no choice, but to keep going, bacsue of having to drive to work.No matter what the weather is.": "anger", "When my parents got divorced when I was a kid, it was one of the hardest things for me.": "sadness", "I understand your pain. My parents are also separated.": "anger", "It does definitely get easier over time I suppose.. Now that I see my life I guess it was for the best.": "sadness", "It just makes you mature faster. Just look at it like blessing in disguise.": "sadness", "Just the other day my girlfriend and I were getting ready for the beach, but right before we left it started to pour rain.": "joy", "That sucks.   Did you end up coming up with an alternate plan?": "sadness", "Well, when looking outside you could see a clear patch in the distance... So we kinda just hoped for the best to wait it out.. We finally did get to go!": "anticipation", "That's good to hear.  How was the beach?": "joy", "There was one day after work that my girlfriend was planning a surprise party with a bunch of friends and family.": "surprise", "That would take away from her time with you. Was it for you?": "sadness", "Yes, the party was for me! I was so shocked and had no clue it was coming.": "surprise", "That would be a really nice surprise then!": "surprise", "There was this one time I stole a shirt from my friend, and I feel pretty guilty about it.": "sadness", "why'd you steal it ": "sadness", "Because I really liked it, and didn't think he'd care.": "sadness", "oh yea what kind of shirt was it ": "sadness", "My girlfriend recently went on a business trip for a week, I was very lonely during this experience.": "sadness", "What did you do to pass the time?": "joy", "I mainly just played video games and watched tv.": "joy", "I love video games.": "surprise", "I moved to a new apartment and they didn't accept my dog breed, so I had to give her up. :(": "sadness", "That sucks, why didn't you find a new apartment?": "sadness", "Because here in my area in Florida, there isn't too many options for me.": "fear", "Maybe you should leave Florida.": "anger", "My mom doesn't have a ton of money, but last christmas she made sure to get me some awesome things!": "surprise", "Oh thats nice, what was she able to get for you?": "trust", "She got me a brand new laptop I had been wanting for gaming!": "surprise", "thats awesome of her to be able to get you something you really wanted": "trust", "I went on this ride at the beach called the Slingshot.. It shoots you super high up in the air.. It was so teriffying, I had so much faith in the ride I wouldn't die!": "fear", "Omg, I have seen one of those!": "fear", "It was seriously so scary, I almost pooped myself!": "fear", "I believe that!": "surprise", "There was this time I went to the bar with my girlfriend and once I came out of the restroom, I saw her talking to some guy!": "disgusted", "What did you do?": "joy", "Well I get super jealous and angry of course..

I was very drunk..": "anger", "Oh wow. Did she break up with you?": "sadness", "No.. I realized the mistake I made and took action so it never would happen again.": "sadness", "Don't sweat it man. There is plenty of fish in the sea anyways.": "sadness", "There was this one time I was driving down the road, and this guy on a sports bike popped a wheelie.. It was so sick!": "disgusted", "Nice, I wish I could do a wheelie!": "surprise", "I know! I do too.. I think I need to learn to ride a sports bike first.. Hehe oops!": "sadness", "Yeah, I tried skateboarding in my childhood but was too scared to break something, lol.": "fear", "When i was younger, I came back to the house with my family to find our family pet dead.": "sadness", "Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Did you ever figure out what happened?": "sadness", "He was very old, so I guess we were all expecting it.. He lived a good life!": "sadness", "Oh, well that's a somewhat happy ending I suppose.": "sadness", "My dog chewed a hole in my carpet 2 weeks ago..

Like you said, we can't all be perfect.": "sadness", "We walked, we ate ice cream, we rode a bike, we laughed a lot, we enjoyed the outdoors, we were exhausted": "sadness", "Who did you do all those things with? Sounds like a wonderful day!": "joy", "I had time that I did not share with the children and that was something that was pending in my soul": "sadness", "They must have been really happy.": "surprise", "Sometimes one gives priority to work": "trust", "The world is very beautiful": "joy", "There are so many spectacular views on this planet": "trust", "Exactly. Look at the beautiful scenery around you. Nature at its very best. I am surprised people don't notice": "joy", "It's a shame that people are letting these marvels pass them by.": "anger", "People are getting busy everyday with other stuff and they forget to breathe fresh air. Leads to s stressful life": "joy", "I can remember feeling so disillusioned when someone who I really admired as a visionary turned out to be a real jerk on a day-to-day basis.": "trust", "That can really make you lose your faith in wanting to trust people": "trust", "Well, it definitely makes you a little more realistic when you may be tempted to put someone on a pedestal. Not really fair to them *or* to yourself, is it?": "trust", "No not really because we are all human and make mistakes.": "sadness", "As a kid, I was SO frightened any time there was a tornado warning. Not sure if it was the Wizard of Oz effect or what -- I just remember being frozen with fear.": "fear", "Oh, wow! My son was terrified of tornadoes because of that darn movie, and we don't really even get tornadoes where we live! Did you ever live through a tornado?": "fear", "That's the thing -- NO! I mean, there were some that were kind of close -- but NOTHING like what so many folks have to deal with. I just remember wanting a basement sooooo badly -- not something that's common where I grew up!": "sadness", "Aw, poor little thing! How did you overcome this? Or, are you still afraid of them?": "sadness", "My mom said the best thing once when I was babysitting and a tornado warning went off and I didn't want my own fear to affect the little boy I was with -- she was on the phone and just said \"You have big plans for the future, right? Nothing is going to get in the way of that.\" For some reason, it worked a charm ;-)": "fear", "Your mom sounds awesome!  Wow, what a cool thing to say!  ": "joy", "I feel so bad when I think back to times that I got angry and yelled at my kids for no real good reason -- just a combination of the day's events and feeling irritated, really.": "sadness", "We get carried away with our emotions sometimes. Did you explain it to them?": "sadness", "Yes! THAT I feel good about! Making a point to use it as an opportunity to talk. I've definitely used it when it comes to the way others might act -- emphasizing that it's not about *them*, it's really about the person and where they're at.": "sadness", "I'm glad you're not too prideful to admit your mistakes to your kids and used it as a teaching opportunity.": "sadness", "I do look at that as a strength, in anyone. Being able to say \"I'm sorry\" and \"I made a mistake.\"": "sadness", "I was SO excited the first time we were going to make an overseas move! I looked so forward to what I knew would be a life-changing adventure!": "joy", "That is pretty awesome, I know if I ever got the chance it would change my life as well.": "joy", "I highly, highly recommend it. Not always easy -- culture shock *is* a thing! -- but such a great way to enhance one's perspective.": "surprise", "I understand that, as long as I could understand the language I think I would be great anywhere.": "fear", "i would fear my gift ": "fear", "tell me more about this": "sadness", "my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me": "joy", "if its an older iphone i would treasure it ": "surprise", "yes but its a valuable gift to me ": "sadness", "everyone values things differently": "sadness", "yeah but this gift is definitely different for me": "sadness", "I have such an amazing husband!

Hurrying around!": "sadness", "Yeah, that can be annoying especially in Walmart since so many people go there. It stresses you out when you don't need it to.": "anger", "Yes! They cut in front, and bump into you. Plus being rude while they do it ": "sadness", "Yeah, everyone just seems miserable, so it kind of drags you down, too. But it's a necessary evil.": "sadness", "I'm so sleep deprived and my baby wanted to play in the middle of the night and i just yelled at him :( i feel so terrible": "sadness", "that is why I am scared to have kids, that sounds terrible": "fear", "i love being a mother but sleep deprivation is so horrible": "sadness", "that seems to be the case, you win some you lose some I guess": "sadness", "I love being around them and it's great to see them each year.": "trust", "Who would that be?": "anger", "O I'm sorry, my niece and nephews, only seem in the summer.

What bills did you have to pay?": "trust", "rent and electricity. we've been struggling financially so it's such a relieve to pay bills": "trust", "Sorry to hear that. Well, at least this will be a weight off your shoulders.": "joy", "I studied so hard for my bar exam so that I could become a lawyer. I prepared for almost 3 months straight!": "joy", "wow, you're so determined! Did you pass your exam?": "joy", "I did pass!

": "sadness", "my husband called me a punk today for no reason. and then when i told him he hurt my feelings he didn't even understand why ": "sadness", "Forget him. Get yourself a real man.": "sadness", "no.. i love him. but he can be such a punk sometimes": "anger", "If he really loved you, he would pay attention to your every need. Kick him to the curb.": "trust", "When I was younger, I got my driver's license. I was sooo scared to drive, because i didn't want to get into an accident.": "fear", "Be positive. Don't deviate your mind while driving. Concentrate completely on driving. You can.": "anger", "I tried to tell myself that, but my dad got into a really bad accident once, and it has scared me ever since.": "fear", "Sorry to hear this. Hope you'll get out from this fear and become a good driver. ": "fear", "I recently started learning to propagate my tomato plants by planting clipped off branches.

Driving around town is just crazy.": "anger", "People just don't seem to pay attention when they are in a hurry.": "anger", "Yes, exactly! They are always speeding or cutting you off. And of course no blinker use!": "sadness", "That's the part that bothers me the most. When they just cut in front of you with no warning.": "anger", "A few years ago, I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other, so we met up in person!": "sadness", "I know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff. Has been pretty great for me after 11 years. How is it for you so far.": "trust", "I'd say it's going pretty well, we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?": "joy", "Well we met through going to conventions and i even visited some myself. Really great bunch of people and i see places.": "joy", "OKay. I care for everyone": "fear", "well you sound like a good person": "joy", "Thanks, I hope I am.

It caught both of us off guard": "surprise", "Oh wow. That's crazy.": "sadness", "Yes, it was a very interesting time. I wish to continue talking to her despite living in different locations": "sadness", "I'm glad you made amends then and no drama.": "anger", "My wife was able to get a job with Microsoft without going to a four-year college!": "trust", "That's pretty amazing. She must be skillful regardless.": "surprise", "She really is. It just shows that you don't need to have a four-year degree in order to be successful.": "joy", "Yea, experience and skills matter a lot more.": "trust", "I walked my dog outside, and she still pooped in the house! Ugh.": "disgusted", "I am familiar with that.  That is frustrating.": "anger", "Yeah...Even though I take her outside, 10 minutes later, she'll poop or pee in the house. Why!?": "anger", "I ask myself the same thing.  Sometimes I think they get mad at something we do.": "anger", "I think being with my husband makes me a better person": "sadness", "That is good.

I'm literally doing the same thing right now, babysitting my neighbor's dogs in her big two-story house, all alone.

That sounds heartless. Maybe that shows you who your friends truly are, and you should maybe look elsewhere... Could be a wake-up call.": "anger", "Well the party was for me, hahaha they really got me on that one!": "surprise", "Oh, I misunderstood! I thought you meant you weren't invited to one that you later found out about. Hah! Then I guess the wake-up call is you have really good friends! So, you like surprise parties then? I never did.": "surprise", "Its not fun being reminded of things you've forgotten.": "sadness", "What kinds of things are you talking about?": "sadness", "Owed money to my mother in law for something, $15, she reminded me in a less then nice way.": "sadness", "That's not very fair, a kind reminder could've gone a long way.": "sadness", "Exactly, especially since she owes me a lot more of something being paid over time.": "anger", "I went to San Antonio the other day, was great to see that city.": "surprise", "I have been there many times.": "sadness", "O really?

I hate seeing that!": "disgusted", "Yea, he had eaten to much sugar and well, it didn't end well": "sadness", "Sugar will do that to kids every time.

They don't have one near by but she was traveling and the airport up north did.": "sadness", "Yeah, but Chipotle has queso now! But, yeah, it isn't as good as Qdoba queso. ": "joy", "Yesterday i watch on tv a kid who could speak 4 different languages at age 3, i was in shook!": "joy", "Wow!

No one laughed or even really cracked a smile, so it put me off for the rest of the presentation.": "sadness", "That is no fun, you always hope that first one hits so they are more receptive the rest of the time": "sadness", "Yeah, and I really thought it was a decent story.  Nothing ground breaking, but at least should have gotten a chuckle.": "sadness", "Well there is always next time!": "sadness", "My wife went to Germany to attend a language course at the end of June.  I've been mostly spending time with my dogs while she's been gone since we recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.": "sadness", "you should take the dogs to a dog park after work and meet people!": "anger", "That's a good idea.  I don't know where there's a dog park near me, I should look into that.": "fear", "Definitely. I think even Waze app will tell you in you search 'around me'.

But I do not know": "trust", "Huh, well maybe he is starting his campaign lol": "joy", "But beyond that. Small gestures make others' lives happier": "sadness", "My neighbor has a really annoying little dog that she always brings outside when she's smoking.  It barks constantly at everything and she doesn't try to keep it quiet.": "anger", "What type of dog is it?": "trust", "A Pomeranian.  I don't have anything against that type of dog specifically, but this one is just terrible.": "sadness", "I get that, some are just not well trained at all": "anger", "This morning my husband received a call, he got nervous, I think it was a woman ... difficult": "fear", "Oh? That's not good. Do you think he has lots of secrets?": "trust", "I think so ... I'm a little worried, because of the situation": "fear", "I'm sorry :( I do hope things can be worked out": "sadness", "Thank you for your solidarity": "trust", "I have a great picture from my wedding where my friends and I are in a circle having a shot, makes me want to go hang out with them again.": "sadness", "I assume you don't get to see them often?": "sadness", "Yeah, we moved away a few months after the wedding for my wife to go to Graduate school.": "sadness", "That's too bad.

How old is he?": "sadness", "He is 12 years old, but he must understand that friendship is something sacred": "sadness", "Friendship is special. Did he do something to his friend?": "surprise", "he hit him and said a bad word": "anger", "When my brother got out of college he had a job and a car and was doing so fucking great for himself. Everything was lined up and he was ready to take off in the world. The moment I graduated college I have nothing that I can do. I took the same degree but that 5 year gap has led me to have nothing compared to him. It was so fucking annoying ": "joy", "Man, that's gotta be a horrible feeling. I think it would help if you try not to compare yourself to others.": "anger", "I do my best but sometimes that's super hard. I guess that's just one of those things everyone got to deal with.

It kinda made me sad, because it was all tattered and dirty. I ended up washing it.": "sadness", "What will you do with it now?": "joy", "You know, I see all the back to school shopping and I think parents have their priorities mixed up.": "sadness", "How so?": "joy", "Parents are more worried about appearances than learning. It's about school supplies not new Jordans or under armor. ": "joy", "That's pretty much teaching their kids to worry about appearances than learning, too. That's too bad.": "joy", "I found a poor stray kitten on the side of the road, and I nursed him back to full health. Poor thing.": "trust", "Did you name it?": "sadness", "I did! His name is Alphy.": "surprise", "That's cute. I bet he's happy.": "joy", "It's hard as a parent, when your kids are teenagers and have to handle their own problems": "trust", "You kinda want to hold their hand, but you know it's best they solve some problems on their own.

We had to finally take him to the vet yesterday.": "sadness", "Is he going to be okay?": "trust", "Yeah, it was ear mites and he got medicine for it. You can tell he isn't feeling good from side effects so I've been babying him.": "sadness", "Well I bet he appreciates that. We all want to be babied sometimes.": "sadness", "I bought a chocolate bar for my wife at the store, and I was going to give it to her, but I ended up eating it...I feel bad.": "sadness", "Lol. Did you tell her? You can just buy another one.": "sadness", "lol I didn't tell her...Should i?": "sadness", "Just buy another one and don't eat it. lol": "sadness", "Don't you hate it when you get in trouble for something you didn't do? My boss got mad at me for someone else's mistake.": "anger", "That's sucks. Does the culprit know?": "anger", "Yeah, that's the worst part. They warned me that I was going to get yelled at because of something they did.": "sadness", "That is unacceptable. What are you going to do?": "anger", "I'm taking a vacation and going on a cruise to Alaska next week!": "joy", "That sounds so fun! ": "joy", "I've never been, so it's going to be an amazing experience. I'm a little nervous that I'll get seasick.": "fear", "Take some medication with you just in case.": "sadness", "Hello, I think I will not forget the beauty of her hair, the sweetness of her lips and the clarity of her eyes": "joy", "So...what happened to her": "sadness", "she died ... my mother": "sadness", "In real life? Or are you making this up": "sadness", "It is true...": "sadness", "Hello, I never imagined the violence that can unleash a dog attacking a bird ... I was impressed": "fear", "I've never imagined something like that before. Where did you see this?": "joy", "in a big dog ... in the park": "joy", "That's nuts. Did the owner do anything?": "disgusted", "I did not have the strength to control it": "fear", "My poor neighboor is suffeing a lot without her husband": "trust", "I suffer a lot too when my wife is gone. What happened to him?": "sadness", "He passed away from cancer.": "sadness", "Ah, the evil cancer. Took my grandmother as well. I am sure he's off in a better place now.": "sadness", "I enjoyed my day the other day, found out something good! Newphew may come to live with us for ayear.": "trust", "Nice! How old is your nephew?": "joy", "11, he wants to see us for more then 2 weeks a year.": "sadness", "That's good. Gotta build and maintain those family bonds. I should be doing the same once my nephew gets older.": "joy", "I lost something of my mother in laws the other day, I feel so bad.": "sadness", "That sucks. Can you make it up to her somehow?": "sadness", "I'll have to buy her another piece of tupperwear, it seems silly but it's expensive stuff!": "sadness", "At least those things come in sets, so you can keep part of it?": "sadness", "I may do that!": "fear", "I was waiting to see if i was going to receive an award": "anticipation", "It is a work award or something?": "joy", "Its an award due to achieving my work I have worked hard for": "joy", "I am sure you are going to get it.": "joy", "I appreciate that.

Everything will work out in the end. No need to worry.": "fear", "THanks for being so understanding!  I feel a little better now.": "sadness", "I felt sooooo nervous going to my last job interview! Nerves must occur in proportion to how badly you *want* something!": "joy", "I know what you mean. Did you get the job?": "fear", "I did! The company does something that I actually like -- a panel interview vs a series of one-on-ones. Have you ever had an interview like that?": "surprise", "I have not. What is it?": "joy", "It just means you're in a room with several representatives from different parts of the company. To me, that helps it feel more like a conversation -- and it's more time efficient too!": "fear", "I know I'm not a perfect parent but some just aren't good at it or don't care.": "anger", "There are some bad parents out there, that's for sure. Is it hard to be a parent?": "trust", "It is when it comes to all the unexpected stuff. Went to the mall today and lady was letting her toddler run all over the mall smelling like a dirty litter box. It smelled horrible.": "disgusted", "Lol, that is terrible. She should have changed his diaper before leaving the house what the heck...": "disgusted", "I always feel like no one hears me. Like When I speak it falls on deaf ears.": "fear", "That sucks. Maybe it's time to get new friends?": "anger", "Well, for the most part it's my family. My husband, kids and pets. I know they're not deaf and it's frustrating!": "sadness", "Don't worry, it will get better. I know you deserve better": "sadness", "My daughter is a teenager now so we don't spend as much time together as we used to.": "sadness", "I know exactly what you mean. My sister is entering her teenage years. I feel like it's all I can do to just not be annoying to her, so I can't even imagine what it's like for a mom.": "anger", "Yeah, luckily we had a fun girls evening out today. We went out to eat and did a bunch of shopping.": "joy", "That's good! All it takes is a good day once in a while to keep things on track until they get older. My mom just tries to be as patient and considerate with my sister so that she still feels motivated to communicate with her.": "joy", "I'm really looking forward to this trip I have planned next week.": "anticipation", "Where are you going?": "joy", "I'm going to visit the national parks in california... well the ones not on fire.": "sadness", "I've never been to California.": "sadness", "I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend, and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.": "joy", "That must of been terrible.": "sadness", "It WAS. Since she was wet, the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.": "sadness", "Did anyone help you?": "sadness", "Been having a good day, relaxing on my couch watching Netflix. I got a nice cup of hot chocolate and my cat curled up in my lap.": "joy", "You're making me want to do the same thing. That sounds great!": "joy", "Yeah, it's been a great day. Thinking about moving to the bed and going to sleep next.": "joy", "Nothing like relaxing and getting your body ready for a night of good sleep!": "joy", "I had a job interview yesterday. I was really nervous before it started.": "fear", "Was it on the phone or in person?": "sadness", "It was in person.

Thats a fun hobby.": "joy", "Well habe fun I guess.": "joy", "It was bad and ontop of it they refused to admit their mistake": "disgusted", "Oh no, what happened?": "sadness", "placed an order online and the appliance place didnt have it, so they gave me something else without telling me": "sadness", "Oh, that's odd! I'm sorry they didn't tell you what was going on. ": "fear", "Thanks for hearing me out. I filed a complaint at the council. I hope they listen": "anticipation", "No problem! I hope so too. Good luck with that!": "joy", "I really was distraught": "sadness", "really?": "sadness", "yes. Makes me value human-human interaction a lot more. I had to go to the grocery store to feel ok": "sadness", "it made me proud he was my rep": "surprise", "Who was your rep?": "fear", "the president represented us at this association": "surprise", "Aha. What was the association?": "joy", "International Ceramic trading": "joy", "It has been very quiet in here since she went on vacation. No one to talk to.": "sadness", "Did you got bored?": "sadness", "I kept myself occupied with movies and video games. But it wasn't the same as having real company.": "sadness", "I understand.": "sadness", "I can't wait to travel south to get my favorite take out. Can't find it here.": "joy", "That is a very long drive! How long will it take to get there?": "joy", "About an hour. But it'll be worth it.": "joy", "It must be very good, if you're willing to go that far!": "joy", "I'm quite happy with where I live. I have 3 swimming pools to use anytime I want and also a gym.": "joy", "Wow, you're very lucky. Do you share the facilities with other people?": "trust", "Yes but there's hardly anyone else who uses them because they only come for 2 weeks out of the year for a vacation. I'm here permanently.": "anger", "Which part of the country are you in? Are you by the beach?": "joy", "I have never been so shocked than when my husband threw me a birthday party without me knowing.": "surprise", "Was it fun?": "joy", "It was so much fun. I thought is was going to be another normal day. Wake up, go to work, etc. but I was wrong about that!": "joy", "Was it recently? Happy Birthday": "sadness", "Yes, last week. Thank you!": "joy", "It was a long 3 weeks but I'm so happy it's over and she's back now": "joy", "Oh goodness, what happened for the past 3 weeks?": "joy", "She went to visit her family": "sadness", "Oh, I was thinking something bad happened.": "sadness", "It was a very hard experience in my soul to lose my mother": "sadness", "Sorry to hear this! I can understand your pain. ": "sadness", "Take care of yourself and your family.": "sadness", "thanks": "sadness", "We knew she was pregnant, but didn't know the gender yet. Imagine my shock when I saw the ultrasound for the gender!": "anticipation", "I am sure it will be fine, do you have a preference": "fear", "Well it's a boy. Which is what I have been wanting since we met": "joy", "I am happy for you then": "joy", "Even though there are plenty of flirts around, I remain loyal to my wife.": "trust", "That is good, it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship!": "trust", "It is the most important thing to me. I have told her since day one, which was 5 years ago now.": "trust", "Good for you! I wish more people were like this, unlike my ex! ": "joy", "My friend got a new truck, I'm really envious of him.": "anger", "You should channel that envy into motivation!": "anger", "I agree, if I work hard I could buy that truck. ": "sadness", "Exactly, be positive and you can buy one for yourself!": "joy", "I should, I just need the drive to get out there and do it. I need to stop wasting money.": "anger", "Hello, I feel that today is going to be a wonderful day .... I will enjoy it": "joy", "That is a great attitude to have!  It is great to have an optimistic approach to life.": "anticipation", "If I really like to be positive, despite the difficulties": "anticipation", "I feel the same way.  We are a glass half full kind of people!": "sadness", "so it is ... a big hug": "sadness", "I have been looking after my wife this week. She has the flu": "trust", "oh poor thing, is she at least getting better?": "sadness", "It seems so.

I don't really know anyone here, so I don't know what I'm going to do while she's gone.": "sadness", "It is an excellent opportunity, to know other people and places, to open up to the possibility, I assure you that it will go to you very well": "joy", "I'm sure it is great for her, but it makes me feel a little unsure of what to do with myself.": "fear", "You do the same thing ... the opportunity is for both": "sadness", "Hello, I made a serious mistake. I made a comment without bad intentions of the elders. I related them to the dinosaurs, and my father heard it ... he looked me in the eyes ... and he told me that you too could be one of them ... I felt bad": "sadness", "That sounds like it's rough, did your father accept your apology?": "anger", "yes, but I feel like a cockroach": "disgusted", "Well, I'm sure he understands, and you shouldn't feel too bad, as long as you apologized you're fine.": "sadness", "I'm supposed to be on a diet, but I couldn't help myself and I ate three chocolate bars.": "sadness", "it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes. dark chocolate is actually good for you!

He works so much so i could stay home with our baby": "joy", "I'm sure your supportiveness inspires him to work as hard as he does": "anger", "I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.": "anger", "I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window. ": "anger", "Ugh, that's the worst.  Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.": "anger", "My bedroom is first floor, and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot. Lucky me. Lucky you tho too with animals. lol ": "fear", "I lost my favorite hoodie somewhere. I'm so upset. Like how could i lose a hoodie? it's so big, did i just leave it somewhere?": "sadness", "Did you retrace your steps": "fear", "I've been to so many places on that day it would be really hard to do it": "joy", "I used to lose stuff all the time.

I left early to get to the airport to get her when she came back because I was excited to see her.": "sadness", "I would be too, that is a long time!": "joy", "Yeah, it's especially long since we only recently moved and I don't really know anyone outside of work.": "sadness", "Wow that would make for a lonely timeframe": "sadness", "I wish my neighbors were more considerate. They woke me up at 4am recently.": "anger", "Wow did youcall someone about that?": "anger", "No point. Their smoke alarm went off and management don't care anyway.": "fear", "Wow, that sucks, that is why I wanna live all alone!": "sadness", "Me too! I really don't appreciate their lack of manners - it's as if they own the whole complex!": "disgusted", "my friend came over yea=sterday and we were sitting on the couch chit chatting and when i got up i accidentally farted. so embarrasing": "sadness", "Oh my, did they notice you farted?": "sadness", "she did, she didn't say anything but i know she heard it": "sadness", "Must have rather awkward.

I give thanks for the good things and the things that do not, the good things make me feel good and the satisfaction and the bad things are internal growth": "trust", "that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way": "anticipation", "For me it was a hard learning ... but after many blows ... I assimilated it": "joy", "how long have you looked at life this way? is it sustainable ?": "joy", "for a year ... you assimilate it when you realize that you are responsible ... neither the people nor the circumstances are responsible": "trust", "this is completely true. it involves totally re conditioning the mind .": "joy", "condition the mind and spirit": "sadness", "i would totally attempt it ": "surprise", "I lost my mother to breast cancer several years ago and I am still grieving the loss.": "sadness", "I am so very sorry. Have you had time to talk about it": "sadness", "yes, I talk about it but it really does not help much. I pray a lot and that gives me some comfort ": "trust", "that's good prayer can comfort, maybe you should talk to your pastor": "sadness", "I dont have a pastor, or a church I can go to. I meditate and I pray and I watch preachers on Sunday morning tv. All of those do help some. ": "trust", "I had plans to move from Florida to California, but I'm starting to get cold feet...": "sadness", "Ooh, that's a big jump. I was considering the same thing, but I' one state above :)": "fear", "Ohh! Did you change your mind? I'm trying to convince myself that it's going to be better for me to make the move.": "sadness", "I put it on hold until I fly up there this year to check things out. It's quite a big decision, and I would recommend going there for a while just to see what it's like": "fear", "today I think today is a day to learn, to hug, to smile, to make someone happy": "sadness", "Yes, realistically I wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way ": "joy", "that's right ... but I dedicate an hour to do that, to my children I kiss them, my neighbor smiled at him and from life I try to learn something": "trust", "Maybe thats a good idea, to try and set aside a small amount of time a day to do it instead of trying to do it all the time along with everything else going on. Good idea!": "sadness", "It makes me feel good that my reflection serves you ... I send you a smile": "joy", "I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends, no husband, no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life": "sadness", "Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?": "sadness", "not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward": "sadness", "Same here.  Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.": "anger", "My wife has been out of the country for almost 2 months.

It is around the current river ": "joy", "I was planning my wedding and trying to get a caterer.  The one we were looking at was completely ignoring every time my wife tried to communicate with them, to the point where I told them off and went with someone else.": "anger", "Sounds like you made the right decision.  What a bunch of A-holes": "joy", "Yeah, it was weird, the caterer was a woman so I can't imagine it was like a sexism thing, but she responded to me almost instantly every time.": "sadness", "Hm maybe she liked you ha": "sadness", "I got a free pizza from Domino's but felt bad about how it happened.": "sadness", "Free pizza is good! How did you get it?": "joy", "The pizza took forever to get delivered so I asked if it was free.  The delivery girl, who was brand new, didn't know so she just didn't charge me.": "anger", "That is awesome!": "joy", "Well, I like free pizza for sure. But I still felt a bit concerned that they might take the cost of it out of her paycheck.": "fear", "how was your day?": "sadness", "It was fine how about you?": "fear", "yeah good. whats your name?": "joy", "I'm not sure I feel comfortable telling you as we just met.": "joy", "oh its fine nice to chat with you unknown friend": "sadness", "hello how was your day?": "sadness", "My day was great so far!

That is the reason.": "sadness", "Ah. Well, chalk it up to one of those funny but awkward moments of life then!": "sadness", "ohh": "sadness", "I went for a job interview, and it seemed to go pretty well.": "joy", "That's great! When will you find out?": "joy", "It should be a couple weeks, assuming they go at the pace they said they would.": "anger", "Good luck! I hope you get it.": "joy", "I moved far away from my hometown for the first time so my wife could go to grad school.  It's hard to be away from my friends.": "sadness", "I know how it feels to be homesick, but you have to put your wife first.": "sadness", "Yeah, definitely, that's why I went ahead with the move.  I'm just not very good at meeting people, so it can be tough.": "sadness", "You and your wife should go out to events and try to meet new people.": "sadness", "I took my wife to the airport for her trip out of the country for 2 months.  I felt really bad on the way home.": "sadness", "Ohh man, that is a long time to be alone.  What are you going to do while she is gone?": "sadness", "Mostly work and hang out with the dogs.

It happens to the best of us.": "sadness", "Indeed.  And next time I'll be sure to double-check whose it is before I come aboard.": "fear", "I was looking at old pictures from my first \"adult\" apartment, and thinking about all the times I spent there with friends and roommates.": "sadness", "Nostalgia can be wonderful, can't it?": "sadness", "It can, but it can also hurt sometimes.  It's probably just nostalgia hardcore, but sometimes I wish I could go back to that time.": "sadness", "I feel the same when listening to 90s alternative music": "sadness", "Last night was crazy. I couldn't relax even though I really wanted to.

As long as you aren't hurting anyone, do whatever you please!": "joy", "yeh to that": "sadness", "I had a job interview yesterday that I thought went really well, but it didn't. They just emailed me back and told me that I didn't get the job.": "sadness", "Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that! It doesn't necessarily mean it went bad, though. Maybe they just had a more qualified candidate?": "anger", "I'm just pretty embarrassed, I was so confident. This whole job hunting adventure has been a complete nightmare.": "sadness", "Keep your head up! Job hunting is usually stressful for most people. You got this!": "joy", "I can understand why you might be jealous of your coworker. I would try to keep your head up.": "anger", "I'm not jealous of my co-worker though?

I feel so bad.": "sadness", "That would be sad, do you keep him in a cage?": "sadness", "Fortunately, no. I let him run around the house, but I feel like he gets bored, so I keep the TV on for him.": "anger", "That's nice, what does he enjoy watching?": "joy", "Stealing is wrong. I would also be ashamed of my actions.": "sadness", "Absolutely. Although the world isn't so black and white. Sometimes a person may have to steal to survive. Is it really wrong then?": "disgusted", "If that is the case, I can understand why they had to do it. In circumstances where someone is stealing solely for unneeded person gain, then it is most definitely wrong.": "sadness", "I agree. Stealing someone else's possession when it wasn't necessary for your survival is despicable! I hate a thief!": "anger", "My dog disappeared while I was away at college.": "sadness", "That's so sad, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. How did it happen?": "sadness", "My mother was walking her in a park and the dog fell down a cliff.  She was never found or recovered.": "sadness", "My goodness, that sounds like a tragedy. I'm sure she was a great dog friend of yours.": "sadness", "Yes, I loved her a lot.  It took a long time to get over but it was quite a long time ago at this point.": "sadness", "I'm looking forward to my niece arriving from Washington. I haven't seen her in 2 years!": "joy", "Do you have some big plans for the visit?": "joy", "Probably not, because she is 6 months pregnant. Her husband is in the military and is away, so she will be here when she has her baby. ": "sadness", "Uh oh, have you ever delivered a baby before?": "sadness", "Oh no! And I don't plan on it! I'll leave that to the doctors! ": "fear", "Oh right, I am a doctor.": "fear", "Oh cool! What kind of doctor?": "trust", "I am a baby delivering doctor!": "fear", "Oh wow, you must be very proud of her. That is quite an accomplishment.": "joy", "What was the accomplishment again?": "joy", "My mother just graduated from nursing school in her 50's. She put in a lot of effort, and she proved to herself and others that she could do it.": "surprise", "Wow, that's amazing. What made her want to go back to school?": "joy", "I saw a homeless guy the other day on my way home, and it made me reflect on my own life.": "sadness", "What about this homeless person had you reevaluating things?": "disgusted", "Lately, I've been thinking how miserable I am at my job. As terrible as it sounds, when I saw him, I thought life could be much worse.": "sadness", "What's been bothering you at work? Are you not being fulfilled enough?": "anger", "A violent windstorm blew through my town and uprooted a tree in my yard.": "fear", "Oh no! I hope it didn't fall on anything or anyone!": "sadness", "No, it missed everything but the lawn. And then my neighbor was nice enough to bring over his chainsaw and help me cut it up for disposal.": "fear", "Oh thats really nice! Its important to help each other out when things like that happen!": "trust", "I used to know someone who got incredibly famous.": "surprise", "Who??? Male or female.Actor or singer?": "joy", "She's a female singer. It sort of burns me up because I feel like she doesn't deserve it and she's rather manipulative.": "trust", "Please tell me who she is!!!!!": "joy", "Sorry, I won't do that.  But pick the female singer you dislike the most and pretend it's her.": "anger", "Years ago I used to have such a good time. I had money to spend, time to do the things I love. How I long for those times again!": "sadness", "I know exactly how you feel, I've been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently. It was so much better when I had the money to pay for everything.": "sadness", "Didn't the sun always shine back then, when we were happy and young and had money?!": "sadness", "Hahaha yes, you are so right. Then again, I'm a Christian so I am also comforted when I remember that we have a real, more important and awesome life to look forward to one day.": "joy", "That's true. I still like to look fondly upon the past, but the future will be bright, too.": "sadness", "Someone broke into my apartment last week. I was not home at the time, but now I worry that they will come back.": "sadness", "Wow, that's terrible. Was anything stolen or damaged?": "anger", "Yes, my TV was stolen. They also clogged every toilet in my apartment. I think they have just eaten Thai food.": "disgusted", "What a story, it's just unbelievable how these robbers have absolutely no morals.": "anger", "I woke up this morning, and my mailbox had been smashed in. I think the neighborhood teens had smashed it with a bat.": "sadness", "That is is awful.Did you call the cops": "anger", "I did, they are investigating currently. I hope they find the hoodlums.": "surprise", "You should install security cameras outside your house.": "anger", "I did not get the job that I had interviewed for. I thought the interview went well, but I guess not.": "sadness", "That's rough man. Got any back up interviews lined up?": "sadness", "Not as of now. I have applied to a couple of other jobs.": "anticipation", "I hope that you hear back from them soon. It ain't going to be rough forever - someone has got to recognize your worth eventually!": "sadness", "Last week, my pants fell down in gym class. The elastic strap holding them up broke.": "sadness", "Oh no, that is terrible! What happened? What did you do!": "sadness", "I ran out of the gym crying, and the whole class pointed and laughed. ": "sadness", "I am so sorry that happened to you!": "sadness", "I love my cat, but she is driving me crazy constantly rubbing up against my face. I have so much cat hair in my nose.": "anger", "Yuck, sounds like an unpleasant feeling. How do you even get hair up there!": "disgusted", "She keeps walking across my chest and rubs on my face as she walks across. I know she's being sweet but it tickles. ": "sadness", "Well, at least she loves you. Maybe shoving all her hair up your nose is her way of telling you that.": "disgusted", "I am going on a vacation this Thursday! I am very excited!": "joy", "Oh really?! Where you headed too?": "joy", "We are heading to Somalia! We had some business dealings to attend to, and we will be seeing the ocean as well!": "joy", "Wow! Thats on the east side of Africa isn't it? ": "joy", "I clogged up the toilet at a female friend's house by accident. I didn't tell them.": "sadness", "Did you have a severe diarreia or something?": "fear", "Yes, it is a legitimate medical condition. I have irritable bowl syndrome.": "fear", "I am sure your friend will forgive you.": "sadness", "I won a prize at an event in my college and felt very happy, proud": "joy", "Oh cool! How did you win it? ": "joy", "It was for a chess competition. ": "joy", "Oh cool! I love chess! What did you win? ": "joy", "They gave a cash money of 200$. Isn't that cool? Have you won any?": "trust", "I have a coworker that will not stop talking. He mostly talks about himself": "anger", "Wow that's annoying, my husband is always telling me about his co-workers being the same way. ": "anger", "Yes, it is quite frustrating. I don't mind listening to people, but I would like them to ask how I am doing from time to time.": "anger", "Yeah I see what you mean. Hopefully he might realize eventually.": "sadness", "I have been waiting on a package my friend sent me to arrive at my house. I heard a knock at the door but it was a package or my roommate.": "anticipation", "Sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone.": "fear", "Yeah it is. I just thought that's what it would be, so it dashed my hopes when it wasn't. I just got keep waiting, I guess.": "sadness", "Well, a wise man said that having patience was a virtue, I think you're becoming a more virtuous person by waiting.": "anger", "I fell walking up the stair today. There was a large group around, and people laughed at me.": "sadness", "I think you should always focus on your strength then it won't matter who is there and what they say": "joy", "That is good advice. I feel better about this.": "sadness", "Also having at least one  friend in such meetings  would help. Next time  go with someone you know": "sadness", "I was delighted the other day when I got to see a friend that I had not seen in 20 years.": "surprise", "That's great, how wonderful! I hope y'all had a good time.": "joy", "It was like we just started where we left off over 20 years ago. It was like we just seen each last week, not 20 years ago.": "sadness", "How great, I'm glad to hear that.": "joy", "I just saw the craziest thing! A baby was riding a dog like a horse outside!": "fear", "How old was the child?": "sadness", "She couldn't have been older than one!": "sadness", "Wow, that's awfully young for that kind of thing.": "sadness", "I was doing some freelance website work for a friend of mine and I did a lot of work for it.  Sadly, it didn't do as well as we had expected it to do, even though I put my best work and most effort into it.": "surprise", "Oh that's not good. It is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere": "joy", "It is.  We're in the process of revamping and coming up with some new and different ideas so hopefully we can do some revisions and get better results.": "anticipation", "Sometimes revamping leads to more amazing results than you could have orginially anticipated": "fear", "That's what I'm hoping for. It's kinda fun when you have to reach into your bag of tricks to see if anything new is there!  ": "surprise", "I'm worried that if my Aunt doesn't answer her phone, I won't be able to give her the keys so she can babysit for me this weekend.": "trust", "Oh no! Are you going away this weekend?": "sadness", "Yes, I am going on a business trip by my son has an important tennis match this weekend. I don't know what I'll do if my Aunt doesn't answer soon.": "joy", "Hopefully, she answers soon. Maybe she's taking a nap or is in the shower.": "surprise", "I am always suffering due to lack of money and I wish I could be rich someday": "sadness", "I am in the same boat, but I think that I can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of I have. ": "joy", "That's good to know. No wonder we are here doing these tasks": "trust", "How funny! I know how you feel though. I have always been poor.": "sadness", "ME TOO. MY Parents have always suffered and so have I. It is so unfair": "anger", "Happiness is within and I seek that all the time. Even rich people are sad and unhappy. ": "anger", "That is so true. But to lead a happy life, money is necessary to some extent.": "sadness", "I was really down after I found out that I was not going to be able to move.": "sadness", "Why? How did that happen?": "sadness", "Becaue I am stuck at a mine site and no one will buy me out. No one wants to live at a mine site with land collapsing everywhere. ": "anger", "That's so sad. I feel sorry for you. ": "sadness", "I feel sorry for me too!": "sadness", "Yeah. Do you have back up plans for this issue?": "anger", "They are very helpful and I always will be faithful to them": "trust", "That's nice, I'm glad you feel that way.": "joy", "Yes, what about you? Do you feel likewise?": "anticipation", "I do feel that way, I try to always have a Christian attitude.": "sadness", "Do you follow any particular denomination?": "joy", "I'm so happy to be able to spend time with my best friend. I was not feeling good and she came over and cheered me up": "trust", "That's nice of her! It's always good to have friends to fall on": "trust", "yes, and she also helped me out and paid one of my bills when i was struggling with money": "trust", "Oh, that's even better. That's truly a friend you can rely on. You're very fortunate.": "trust", "I saw this kid on a skateboard the other day.  I thought he was gonna wipe out hard, but he pulled off some kind of multi-flip jump thing that really shocked me.": "surprise", "Skateboarders have some serious skills! I can barely walk a straight line.": "joy", "I know, right?!  I tried skateboarding once when I was a kid, made it to being able to kind of not fall over in a straight line, never managed to do anything else.": "surprise", "We all have different talents. Mine do not lie in those kind of stunts either lol! ": "surprise", "I always say i hate when other moms shame each other but guess what? i do the same thing!": "anger", "Maybe you could try to better that?": "sadness", "I definitely should! I should be nicer to other moms and don't judge them": "joy", "You could start a trend.": "joy", "I love my baby so much! he is teething right now and i don't even know how to help him :(": "trust", "He will make it": "joy", "I know he will, i just wish i could help him. I gave him Tylenol but he was still pretty cranky": "trust", "It will help eventually": "sadness", "I was walking my dogs the other day and a guy came out with his dog off leash.  The dog ran up and freaked out both my dogs.": "trust", "That must have been scary. It could have gone really badly.": "fear", "Yeah, I was really worried.  My bigger dog got really protective of the smaller one, but thankfully they didn't actually get into a fight.": "trust", "I hope the owner knows better next time.": "sadness", "I just recently finished potty training my dog, that was quite the nightmare with sooo many puddles needing cleaned up.": "disgusted", "Oh man! I hear you. I rescue animals and it is VERY hard to potty train them!": "joy", "I can imagine a rescue, generally being a little bit older than a fresh 8 week old someone would get, can be much harder.. It's a painful process for sure!": "joy", "For sure! It is much like potty training a kid. Actually I think dogs are easier then kids lol!": "joy", "My dog started looking really sick and in pain, but I didn't have the money to take him to an emergency vet, so I had to ask my parents for a loan until I got paid.": "trust", "THat is stressful.  Are they ok?": "trust", "Yeah, he's fine now.  It was some kind of stomach thing, but he got medicine and rest and is good now.": "sadness", "That is really good to hear": "trust", "I was sitting on my back deck drinking a cup of coffee and just felt so wholesome and happy with life. It was great . You ever have any of those moments?": "joy", "I certainly do.  Lucky to be healthy and able": "joy", "I always try to look for the small things. I got to see a hummingbird today and that was great. Anything small in your life make a big impact?": "surprise", "Good question.  I am thankful to be able to park my car in my garage!": "joy", "Oh I can agree with that completely! ": "disgusted", "I interviewed for a job a while back that I was waiting on hearing about.  I felt like it went well.": "joy", "I hope you get the job! What was the position you applied for?": "joy", "A lab manager at a university.  I've got my fingers crossed!": "joy", "That sounds like it pays nice?": "joy", "Have you ever had to file for disability?": "sadness", "No. Why do you ask?": "sadness", "I've had to recently. Its been really tough.": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that. How far along in the process are you?": "sadness", "Do your kids ever do anything cute that turns annoying?": "anger", "I actually do not have any kids right now": "sadness", "My kids love to tell me what they are doing in their video games. It was cute at first, but you can only listen to someone talk about Stardew Valley for so long.": "joy", "I heard that was a really fun game though!": "surprise", "I've had to help take care of others before as well.": "trust", "Seems like we all have. Some people shirk having to though.": "trust", "Yeah, I'm not so lucky. My wifes been sick and I've been taking care of her recently.": "trust", "Oh no.I hope she gets better.": "sadness", "I failed my driving test twice, but I was really encouraged and did better the next time.": "sadness", "Well that's good, sometimes it's our failures that really show us what we're made of. ": "sadness", "I agree, I practiced and practiced and I was pleased when I passed my third time. Persistence is key.": "joy", "Congratulations. I am in my twenties and still can't drive so hopefully I will get my license next year.": "joy", "I once went a restaurant, and I saw rats running around in the back kitchen! ": "disgusted", "Did you say anything to someone?": "sadness", "I reported it! I was shocked and grossed out, how can a place like that operate!?": "disgusted", "a Burger King near me got shut down for that!": "fear", "Do any of your kids play any sports?": "joy", "No, I do not have kids. Yours?": "joy", "My daughter skateboards. She went down the big ramp the other day. It was so cool.": "surprise", "I bet you were really proud!": "joy", "I was so late for work one day, I walked out and forgot to put on my pants!": "sadness", "Wow. Thats hard to believe lol.": "sadness", "I was so concerned about getting to work I forgot to throw them on, I was so in shock, even the neighbors saw. It was bad.": "anger", "Yeah, it sounds that way.": "sadness", "I had to wait in line for 15 minutes at the store today. There was only one poor cashier working.": "joy", "That must of been a pain! I hate waiting in lines for cashiers, they are so slow sometimes.": "anger", "The cashier couldn't help it. The store should hire more people.": "anger", "Stores should really open more checkouts when it is busy, especially during rush our!": "disgusted", "I was so excited when I got my new puppy, it was awesome!": "joy", "Man, I'm so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage, as tumultuous as it can be. There's just so much emotion and \"new feelings\" going on as you watch it grow.": "joy", "I agree with you, the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions, positive ones of course!": "joy", "Yeah, but then there's also those late nights where you have to take them out because they're not used to holding their pee/poop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy, so it's hard to keep up sometimes, but also fun!": "disgusted", "Those were simpler times, I wish I could go back and relive those days!": "sadness", "What were simpler times?": "sadness", "Childhood when you did not have so much to worry about.": "sadness", "Ah, I see. Had a great childhood, hu?": "sadness", "It was great, so much time running around outside without a care in the world.": "joy", "I felt like I was on the top of the world when I won the science fair in middle school. No better feeling than that for a small child. ": "joy", "Congrats! That would be really exciting. What was your project?": "joy", "My project was to show what farm poop produced the most gas when it decomposed. I put the poop in a bottle with a balloon on top. Whatever balloon grew the largest, was the one that released the most gas.": "disgusted", "That's a very interesting topic. I would have loved to have seen that!": "joy", "I'm sleep training my toddler, he never slept in his crib before. He is crying and it makes me feel so bad": "sadness", "I know what that's like. I have three kids.": "joy", "how did you cope with all the crying? We've been co sleeping since birth and it's breaking my heart to hear him cry": "sadness", "They never slept in the crib lol. I won't even make my son get a haircut because he cries so much when the clippers get close. I'm the wrong one to come to for advice lol": "disgusted", "I just got back from my vacation. We stayed at a beachfront condo and spent time there, it was so much fun! We really had a blast!": "joy", "That sounds heavenly": "joy", "It was! We hadn't been able to go on a vacation for a couple of years, due to personal reasons, so you can imagine how we felt when we went!": "joy", "I envy you.  Have fun!": "anticipation", "As I look at my 21 year old son, I often reflect on when he was smaller. Time really flies!": "sadness", "Time sure does fly and change is inevitable": "sadness", "Yes, that's true. I still can imagine when he was waking up Christmas morning to see what Santa brought when he was 5.": "sadness", "Thinking about past events can be very nostalgic": "sadness", "I want to go on a vacation next month but now I cant.": "sadness", "what happened?": "sadness", "Mys husbands job sucks and they had to cancel his vacation because they arnt staffed right.": "sadness", "time to find a new job it sounds like! good luck": "joy", "My son is in his last year of college! We are so excited and looking forward to graduation time!": "joy", "Awesome! What is he in college for?": "joy", "He's going to be an Aerospace Engineer! We are very proud of him and how dedicated he is to achieving his dream.": "joy", "Holy goodness! That is really specialized. You should be very proud! :)": "joy", "We took our son to the doctor and luckily he is getting better!": "sadness", "That is very good to hear, hopefully things truly turn around for him.": "trust", "I hope so. Do you have any kids?": "sadness", "Not yet, i just have one dog.": "sadness", "I went to the flea market last weekend!": "joy", "Oh that's neat! Did you find anything good?": "sadness", "Well, kinda... I got a bunch of old Beanie Babies, haha.": "sadness", "Oh I remember when those came out and everyone thought they were going to be worth millions someday! ": "sadness", "I know! They were 25 cents each... it was crazy. They had the coolest store there with all sorts of old stuff from the 80s and 90s. ": "sadness", "I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.": "surprise", "Wow, that's incredible. I don't even make my own bed. ": "surprise", "haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol": "joy", "Of course... haha. Why doesn't anyone pay adults to make their beds?": "sadness", "My aggressive pet rat attacked the baby rat and left her a horrible gash on her abdomen!": "disgusted", "Wow, that sounds very disgusting.": "disgusted", "It looked so horrible. I thought for sure the baby was as good as dead.": "sadness", "I hope the baby rat is okay.": "fear", "She's great. I gave her some medicine and she healed miraculously. It was almost unbelievable!": "trust", "My mother became ill a while back and had to be put into the hospital. I was so concerned, but she became better after a few days. Such a huge relief!": "trust", "I'm so sorry but great to hear she is better now!": "sadness", "Thanks, she is. She had a blood clot in her leg and we didn't know it, so it could have been much, much worse. I can't even express how glad I was when she was better!": "trust", "Well I'm glad to hear it's resolved.": "sadness", "I fed a stray cat that was hanging out in my yard yesterday.": "sadness", "Oh that's nice, I love doing that. Did the cat seem happy?": "joy", "The cat appeared very relaxed, but I could tell it was very pensive about my presence. It took some time to develop some sort of trust.": "sadness", "Well how nice, that must have been fun.": "joy", "One time I was camping out in the woods in California with some friends. I ended up getting lost on my way back to the camping spot in the middle of the night.": "sadness", "Wow that must have been scary!": "fear", "If that wasn't frightening enough, I ended up getting chased by a stranger while I was looking for my camp mates!": "fear", "How long were you lost for?": "sadness", "I didn't force her into anything. She seemed to know what she was doing anyway": "sadness", "Wow back up there friend, what are you talking about?": "sadness", "I wish it never happened now. ": "sadness", "Context, what the heck are you talking about?": "sadness", "she was 8": "surprise", "Seriously what the hell are you talking about??": "anger", "A little while ago, my friend went on another beach vacation. It was her 3rd one for the year. My family and I hadn't been on vacation for several years, due to issues beyond our control, so I begrudged her trip a bit.": "sadness", "Being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response. Despite this, you never know what is going on behind the scenes, she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips.": "trust", "Yes, true, I know they tend to let bills go for things like that, which I don't do. ": "sadness", "I bet you would go on many vacations if you did the same as her. Instead, you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future.": "trust", "I am so happy it's a boy": "joy", "You just had a baby?! I didn't even know you were expecting!": "surprise", "He'll be here in about 3 months": "joy", "I'm so happy for you! Have you decided on a name yet?": "joy", "Hey, I just started the keto diet!": "anticipation", "Good for you! I have heard many great things about keto. How are you finding it?": "anticipation", "It's good so far. I was overwhelmed at first, but I rented some books from the library and got a Kindle Unlimited subscription to find some recipes and info.": "surprise", "Props to you for researching the diet without understanding how it works. Some people are just looking for ways to lose weight fast, but putting in effort goes a long way.": "sadness", "Thank you, I wanted to be completely ready, so I compiled meal plans and grocery lists first.": "joy", "Imagine my surprise after 6 months of trying. Now we also know it's a boy": "surprise", "You must be over the moon happy.": "joy", "I am. Especially when we saw the ultrasound. Takes after his dad if you know what I mean haha": "anger", "Very funny. Have you decided on a name yet?": "sadness", "I just had my Sweet 16 party...": "surprise", "Happy belated Birthday! Did it turn out the way you had hoped?": "sadness", "Well, about that... my dad KNEW I wanted a pink car for my birthday. But...": "anger", "What did you get instead?": "sadness", "A BLUE one! I'm so devastated. I don't know what to do.": "sadness", "I recently enrolled back in my university after dropping out 6 years ago.": "sadness", "Really? That is a good move": "sadness", "I was scared about it at first, but so far I have all A's. I must say, I'm proud of myself!": "joy", "You have As because you have high interest in studying  ": "joy", "Over the past year I've been on a weight loss journey of over 100 pounds.": "joy", "Wow, that is truly incredible! What is your secret?": "trust", "As well as exercise and diet, by far the most important thing is strong will and determination.": "joy", "That is so true! You are a true weight loss warrior I think!": "joy", "I never liked milk growing up, because my family drank skim. ": "sadness", "Do you like it now?": "sadness", "Well, first I tried whole milk, and that was gross. But I just tried 2% milk, and I like it!": "disgusted", "I like 2% as well.  It's perfect for cereal and chocolate milk!": "joy", "I agree! I'm so happy I can enjoy it now.": "joy", "Have you tried 1%?": "joy", "No, but I am satisfied with my choice. ": "joy", "That's great.  2% is much more healthful than whole milk.": "joy", "I just got back from our vacation, but the drive there was so nerve wracking. There was heavy rain and traffic, and some nighttime driving. Had me on edge": "fear", "so very bad ya": "sadness", "Yes, well, it was just one of those things I know, but still was very tiring and can get to you after that drive.": "fear", "Recently, I received the news about my ex boyfriend's relapse.": "fear", "Oh no! :(   How are you taking it?": "anger", "It's definitely a hard situation to take in. He had stopped using when we started dating and was off it for 2 years until we broke up. It's very discouraging.": "sadness", "Dang.  Please don't blame yourself.": "sadness", "On my recent vacation to Florida, there was a very long delay at the toll booths of at least 45 minutes. This was after 7 hours of driving! It was such a hassle!": "anger", "Thats pretty long, how did you manage?": "sadness", "I wanted to pull my hair out lol. But, knew once we were past it, there was the beautiful ocean on the other side...finally!": "joy", "Yea, something calming helps during fraustrating moments, but at least you know how the route is now": "anger", "Robby got me flowers today.": "surprise", "Nice! Who's Robby? Is that your husband?": "joy", "Yes, how could you forget? It was a nice surprise, but then he said.. \"happy anniversary.\"": "surprise", "Aha! Was it actually your anniversary today? Happy Anniversary!": "sadness", "Thanks, but I'm so embarrassed that I forgot!! D; ": "sadness", "dad caught me kissing my half aunt": "sadness", "Oh, wow... um, that's crazy. Why did you do that? ": "sadness", "I was attracted to her. She was older. The worst part was getting hit upside the head in front of her": "anger", "I would imagine! I'd do the same thing if I was your dad, haha.": "sadness", "Me found cave.": "fear", "You sound like a caveman": "anticipation", "Me am caveman. In cave was paint of cave wife. Wife hunt big mammoth.": "fear", "Why you no hunt and send wife instead.": "sadness", "Me miss BC. Me miss wife.": "sadness", "One of the scariest, yet happiest experiences in my life was finding out that I was going to have a baby.": "fear", "Oh I can relate to that especially if you are not prepared for it, it can get really scary": "fear", "Oh, we were totally unprepared.

We had to double on back home to get our lives set up for the big change!": "joy", "You guys will be alright trust me I  experienced same with my partner and now we are fine. Our kid is a teenager now. I am happy for you guys": "trust", "When I was pregnant, I felt ill until it was over. The doctors were worried that something was wrong with the baby.": "fear", "Oh no! I'm not sure how all that works, but I thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman": "sadness", "Usually the sickness stops within the first few months, so the fact that I fell ill so much was worrisome. Despite it all, I had a healthy, bouncing baby boy. I never have felt more grateful in my life.": "trust", "Well I'm glad for you! And for him! A new life is exciting": "joy", "When my dog passed away, I felt so helpless. She was old and suffering and I felt angry that there was nothing I could do other than put her down.": "sadness", "That's so sad. You did your best. How old was she?": "sadness", "She was 14. I got her when she was a puppy. Even though the situation was rough, I'm grateful for all the years we did get to spend together.": "trust", "That's really good, though. It sounds like you gave her a great life.": "trust", "I had to sit in the front while she was in the back with him": "sadness", "Was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with?": "sadness", "I wanted her. But he had the money. And that's what she wanted": "anger", "In that case, you are better off without her. ": "sadness", "My son is in college and about to return for his Junior year. We have made sure to put back ample saving to take care of his financial needs. ": "trust", "Oh, wow, I wish my parents had done that! It would have saved me from the mountain of debt I have now": "sadness", "We felt it was best to make sure to get ready in advance and help as much as we can. But, I know all parents aren't able to do that, or feel they shouldn't, so I can see both sides!": "joy", "Well, I've always been of the mindset that (if they can) they should help the first 2 years as that's usually the break-in period. After that, the child should be able to manage": "anger", "After a long few months of being a hermit, I went out the other day to the shelter to play with some pups!": "surprise", "I bet that felt good to get out and experience that!": "joy", "It was definitely exciting for me!

They are one of life's great joys in my opinion.": "trust", "I've been feeling a bit blue and overwhelmed lately.": "joy", "You should take a vacation that will help you relax and see new stuff": "fear", "I could definitely use one! However, I have a newborn so I'll have to wait a little while before we can go on some adventures!": "joy", "Oh ok. In that case let someone very close like your mother come around to help you out. Having someone to talk to helps in times like this": "trust", "These days my skin has never looked better. My diet is good, my family life is good, I've got good grades. Life is good!": "joy", "That's awesome. Are you using any special types of lotion?": "joy", "Nope! I believe it is mostly due to diet and lots of water.

I wish my skin looked better than it does.": "anger", "I flew all the way to New York City to buy a designer dress for the prom.": "joy", "You must be wealthy.

I hope you got somewhere safe while it was going on.": "fear", "Yes, it luckily passed our home, but you just never know!": "fear", "That's good at least. Living in an area with tornados is so scary!": "fear", "My brother recently proposed to his girlfriend, I'm really happy for him. :)": "joy", "Oh that is fantastic! I bet your brother was pretty happy too.": "joy", "Yeah, he gave her my grandmothers rings, since they were nice and we had them available.

I've had so many problems with them over the years": "sadness", "Yeah, it's horrible. I mean, what's so difficult about shipping to Canada? You can pay for other people to ship the item to you from their address, you'd think it would be just as simple for a big company like that.": "anger", "I know. Canada isn't even overseas in the literal sense, it's just over the border!": "sadness", "she took me for $1600 in just 2 weeks. What a trap": "fear", "Unbelievable. You must be very angry with her (whoever she is).": "anger", "It's been 7 years and I'm still not over it": "sadness", "Neither would I, I dislike such greedy people ": "anger", "Sat here by myself for 10 days straight.

Can you get it back?": "sadness", "At the time I didn't think it was bad. But after she told me she didn't actually like it, that made me think differently": "sadness", "What didn't she like?": "sadness", "Well she had never done it before, so I thought it was special": "sadness", "Well that makes sense.": "sadness", "I'm very proud of her for traveling alone at 6 months pregnant": "joy", "Congrats you have a baby on the way": "joy", "Yes.

How did you handle having two such big priorities come up?": "sadness", "I had to tell my boss I couldn't go and I was so stressed about that. It turned out the weather was bad and all flights go canceled so no one could go.": "sadness", "Oh, sorry to hear. I am sure your child was glad you were home. Is she or he feeling better now?": "sadness", "I wish I had money. Then she'd sit with me instead of him": "sadness", "Sit where?": "sadness", "In the club": "joy", "The club isn't a great place to find the right kind of girl anyways.

And of course there were a lot of people that saw.": "surprise", "hehehe.. don't mind if I giggle do you?  You need to remember... don't feel embarrassed bout silly stuff like that.

Either way it seems like he definitely got the hint. ": "anger", "Last week I had Thai food for lunch, and it didn't sit well with my stomach. I had some explosive issues later in the day at work, and the bathroom was near all of my coworkers' cubicles. Needless to say, the stench ended the workday a little early.": "disgusted", "Oh wow, I have heard that can happen with that food": "disgusted", "Yes, it was quite the uncomfortable experience. Now all of my coworkers have given me the nickname 'Diarrhea Joe'": "trust", "Ha, that is funny": "sadness", "I was on a road trip last week and had to stop a gas station to use the restroom. It looked like they had never cleaned the bathroom, ever!": "disgusted", "ewww! that is just super gross dude!": "disgusted", "I know! The worst part is that I have irritable bowel syndrome, and I made the bathroom about twice as bad as it was initially!": "sadness", "Oh man that is just crazy! Feel bad for the person who has to clean it.": "disgusted", "I stole a TV from a local appliance store. It is a 80 inch behemoth, but I am feeling a little guilty. On the plus side, the 4k picture is astounding!": "sadness", "I would love to have that tv": "joy", "Yes, I am torn between my desire to keep the TV and my guilt. What should I do?": "sadness", "Keep it, the guilt will go away": "sadness", "it infuriates me that my wife expects me to read her mind where she wants to eat.": "anger", "Women these days. I don't think i'll ever understand them.": "sadness", "Me either. If you would like to go to a specific place to eat just tell me. I'd rather do that than hear why you dont like the place we ended up.": "sadness", "Exactly, sometimes I think women like drama.": "anger", "I recently had a long weekend with some old friends. It was fantastic.": "joy", "It must have been fun to catch up with them.": "surprise", "it was. We've spent a lot of time together and apart now, so it was good to catchup.": "sadness", "Well I hope you guys continue to stay in touch.": "sadness", "I just finished two college classes that I have been taking this summer! I am glad to be done.": "joy", "Going to college is a good thing, but taking classes in the summer can really stink. At least you'll get to graduate sooner.": "joy", "Yes, exactly! My professor seemed to be a compulsive liar. For instance, two days ago he claimed that a local church used their 'personal fire department' (due to the large size of the church) to hose down protesters that were aggravated about the church's tax exemptions. Ludicrous!": "sadness", "That is the craziest thing I have ever heard.": "sadness", "Not long ago I realized we are more financially stable than I think we have ever been.": "trust", "That's awesome. What are you going to do about it?": "joy", "Keep moving forwards with our plans and feel great!": "joy", "I'm envious. Do you have any idea of what those plans are?": "anger", "My friends help me and they scold me when necessary ... God will give you happiness": "sadness", "oh i know friends like those": "sadness", "I wish they did not suffer, because it is my suffering": "sadness", "i believe you": "sadness", "Thanks for your comprehension": "joy", "Not long ago we had a horrible storm come through. You could barely see 5 feet outside the window.": "fear", "Oh wow, sounds dangerous. Were you able to stay home and not venture out in it?": "anger", "By the time we noticed how bad it was, we had to stay put. Our phones staying blaring telling us to seek shelter. We piled in the bathroom til it passed.": "sadness", "Did you have any damage to your home?": "anger", "I have a disease called Lupus.  Because I am so sick from this It causes me to lose alot of friends.  I am not able to go out and hand out like I use to because I am just to sick to get out.  It makes me lonely.": "sadness", "That's really sad. Is there a cure for Lupus?": "sadness", "No unfortunately there isn't.  You can sometimes go into remission with really powerful drugs but that isn't guaranteed": "sadness", "I am sorry about that. Is it contagious?": "fear", "no it is an autoimmune disease": "joy", "Hi, I'm separated, I'm hurt and my heart is broken": "sadness", "When did you get separated? By the way, that is terrible to hear.": "joy", "one month I am desolate ... I hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel": "anticipation", "Why are you so down, my depressed friend?": "sadness", "is that he loved her": "trust", "This is terrible but there was this bad smell getting worse and worse in my kitchen. Couldn't find where it was coming from.": "disgusted", "Uh oh!  What did it end up coming from?": "sadness", "Went under the sink for something and when I moved it there was a puddle there. The sink had been leaking and the water was funky.": "sadness", "Yuck!  Clean that up quick so it doesn't grow mold!": "disgusted", "I recently went on a trip with a woman I adore. The trip ended poorly, though, and things have not been the same since.": "fear", "I hate to hear that, what happened that made it end poorly?": "fear", "We did not capitalize well on the short amount of time that we had together.": "sadness", "maybe you can plan another trip together soon - sounds like you guys need some time to reconnect and just truly enjoy each other.": "sadness", "If my upstairs neighbor wakes me at 3am again I think I'll explode! I get that she has to go to work, but why not get organized the night before for goodness sake?!": "fear", "I know the feeling.": "sadness", "You too, huh? How do you nicely ask someone to shut up? Yelling at that time of day just wouldn't be right.": "anger", "Leave a note on their door. and at the end put \"thanks in advance\" lol": "joy", "Nice idea, but I don't think subtlety is their strong point - they'd be liable to make even more noise, lol.": "anger", "Well, you can at least try. ": "sadness", "I guess I could. Or I could just move. Still mad though!": "anger", "You could get earplugs lol": "fear", "I'm seeing my orthopedic surgeon soon and he'll tell me if he can operate on my hip. I so hope he says yes, but the suspense is killing me!": "fear", "Oh man! What happened to your hip?": "sadness", "I fell and fractured it two years ago. My then surgeon botched the operation and I have to use a walker to get around. If this new guy can do something I could walk properly again!": "sadness", "Oh my god..I had doctors really mess me up too. I am in a lawsuit. Have you thought about contacting an attorney?": "sadness", "From what I've read, unless it's a class-action lawsuit my chances are practically nil. The surgeon'll just lawyer up. What happened to you?": "joy", "If it's medical malpractice actually you can get a good amount. Mine is still in talks, it's only been 6 months. Medical malpractice lawyers usually take you on for free if they like your case :) You can always try and you won't be charged if you don't win. It's pretty painless..people killed my child and almost me..": "anger", "Oh dear lord. How unbearably dreadful! I hope that your lawyer takes that creep to the cleaners. Won't bring your baby back but will hopefully ensure he doesn't do it to someone else.": "anger", "Thank you! I hear you..I didn't want to do it at first...but it's worth it for her..It's a few people I am suing.including midwives. If it prevents another childs death then its worth it! You should really look in too it, botched surgery and nerve pain can be horrible! I hope you get better!": "fear", "The weather here feels kinda mild today, I'm shocked that it's only in the 80s in August.": "surprise", "Are you looking forward to the weather this weekend?": "joy", "I am. It's not blazing hot so I plan on mowing the grass and getting some yardwork done.": "joy", "Nice! Mowing the lawn isn't fun in the heat unless you're using a super fast one of course": "joy", "Writing speeches makes me nervous": "fear", "I agree, the writing part is easy part, but the speaking part is the worst!": "anger", "Yeah, it seems like the learning curve is impossible! Maybe I just need more life experience": "anger", "Maybe so, they say to imagine the crowd naked, but I don't think that helps too much with the writing part.": "joy", "True, a lot of people don't even have to think about what they're gonna say": "sadness", "I don't watch a lot of kids movies these days, but they always bring back fond memories": "sadness", "Same. What are your favorites?": "sadness", "I've seen the movie Trolls probably 100 times, that and Harry Potter!": "joy", "That's funny. I've also seen Trolls about 100 times. My daughter is now sick of it!": "sadness", "Yeah, sometimes there's more to those movies than you think, like they actually considered how adults would react": "sadness", "I've noticed a lot of the newer kids movies have adult jokes in them.": "sadness", "Yeah, maybe kids are just getting smarter with the internet and everything": "anger", "Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.": "sadness", "Getting my first job felt like I had a lot more freedom with my life": "joy", "Yeah I get that. Where did you work?": "joy", "Dairy Queen, it was the only restaurant in my town": "sadness", "Oh yum. Not a terrible place to work!": "anger", "True, most of my friends worked there too so it wasn't too boring.": "sadness", "Yes , work is better with friends.": "sadness", "Yeah, so there wasn't too much of a pressure to work really hard, it wasn't too busy either": "sadness", "Really? I'm surprised the only restaurant in town wasn't busy.": "surprise", "Seeing people do good things for each other always brightens my day": "trust", "Did you see that happen today?": "sadness", "Yeah, someone paid for this guy's groceries in the store without asking!": "anger", "That's pretty cool.  What a nice person.": "trust", "Yeah I think we should have more of that kind of thing": "sadness", "Rolling down a huge downhill street with no brakes was fun but nervewracking": "fear", "Whoa!  What were you driving that had no brakes?": "fear", "I found a bike on the side of the road but didn't test it before coasting down this hill": "sadness", "That sounds quite scary!  Did everything turn out OK?": "fear", "Yeah, usually I don't trust myself with those kinds of things, but I decided to go for it, rolled on some grass to lose a little speed": "sadness", "When you're in the sauna and the man next to you decides to take off his towel... No thanks": "anger", "Haha!  Awkward.  What did you do?  Did you hurry up and get out of there?": "sadness", "Yeah, I'm not good with confrontations": "anger", "Same here.  I would rather just leave the situation.": "anger", "I don't think I've ever regretted not saying anything, but sometimes I can say the wrong thing or it just comes out wrong": "sadness", "I found out yesterday at work that I'm one of the top performers for my district!  I figured I was doing good, I didn't know I was doing *that* well!": "joy", "That's great.": "joy", "Usually at the end of the day it's never anything nice when my supervisor wants to talk to me but she broke the news and I was surprised!  Been walking on sunshine all weekend!": "surprise", "Congrats. I want a promotion at my job.": "joy", "How long have you been there?": "joy", "three years.": "joy", "I'm sure you've done some good work - would it be hard to talk to someone and make your case?": "trust", "I think I'm just going to move on.": "sadness", "My bank refunded me 100 bucks over a clerical error!": "anger", "Oh wow! What are you going to buy with all that sweet loot? Firecrackers?": "sadness", "Not sure yet.  I know some of it has to go for groceries, but the rest - I should save it, my burned out laptop needs a new hard drive.": "joy", "That sound like a wise decision. I think I would just get a blow up doll instead.": "sadness", "If I had dispensible funds like that, there'd definitely be an anime pillow with a handsome guy on it, but alas, priorites.  *lol*": "joy", "I found out I was a top ranked performer in my district yesterday!": "surprise", "Cool. Does that get a bonus?": "joy", "I got a gift card to a restaurant locally for my family.  That's a good enough bonus for me - the four of us tend to put a dent in the menu when we go out!  *chuckle*": "trust", "That's awesome. ": "joy", "I'm just happy to be recognized, especially since most times I just see myself as a 'cog in the wheel'.": "joy", "Well now you know you're pretty great at your job.": "joy", "I just do the best I can - that's all anyone really expects.": "surprise", "So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.": "sadness", "Was he upset?": "sadness", "He kinda gave me the \"Mom, really?\" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot.  *chuckle*": "sadness", "I hate when that happens. ": "anger", "I do, too.  I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times!  I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 10 now].": "sadness", "I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions": "fear", "It's easier with a list but still, you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list.  XD": "joy", "You are so right.": "sadness", "I forgot to pick up a bag of chips for my son from the grocery store.": "sadness", "Did you go back?": "sadness", "No, I didn't.  We live in a rural area and the grocery store is 20 minutes away.  Lucky for him, I forgot some other stuff for tomorrow's dinner [mom brain!] and I told him that we could ride together tomorrow back to the store.": "sadness", "Maybe you should let him get a couple of things to make up for it.": "anger", "Multiple bags of chips, to be sure!  *chuckle*  ": "sadness", "Or you can get a variety pack!": "joy", "Those are a lifesaver - he's in Scouts and he's starting soccer soon.  Those 24 packs are the best!": "surprise", "My landlady was really understanding when I told her that I would be late with rent this month.": "sadness", "That's nice. I could get that here.": "joy", "I was nervous about talking to her because I hate having to disappoint her - she's related to me.  So I didn't think she'd be as cool about it as she was.": "fear", "Well now you know.": "sadness", "Yeah, I think that's where the anxiety was - the not knowing.": "fear", "I had a big presentation yesterday but I think I nailed it!": "sadness", "Noice!  What was it about?": "fear", "I had to explain global warming to my son's Boy Scout troop.": "trust", "Very cool, are you a scientist?": "joy", "Nope, just a mom.  I had to do some research on the internet and it was a real eye-opener for me.  I believe in global warming but a lot of the facts on both sides of the argument surprised even me.": "surprise", "I broke up with my boyfriend last week.": "sadness", "Oh no! That's awful.  Or maybe a good thing if he wasn't good for you.  How are you feeling?": "sadness", "Well, I'm hanging in there.  This is the first weekend we've not been together and outside of being online, the quiet is kinda loud.": "sadness", "I bet.  It can be brutal with the change and not having someone but you have to trust yourself that you are doing the right thing.  Its a good time to grieve your time together and then move on and find yourself again.": "sadness", "Yeah.  It's a positive that we broke up, I'm just looking for healthy ways to deal with the energy that's left.": "sadness", "I found out that I'm getting a bonus for having the top rating in my district!": "joy", "Congratulations!  That is amazing!  You must be a hard worker.  What do you do?": "joy", "I help manage distribution for a large company in my city.  Really I just hold a clipboard and crunch lots of numbers.  LOL": "surprise", "That's an important job though!  You're keeping things running smoothly for that business to thrive.  I'm so happy for you.  Money is tight for me so when I hear someone getting a bonus...it just makes me so happy for them to get that added chunk of money!": "joy", "This is my first bonus in 10 years.  After feeling like a cog in the wheel, it's nice that someone noticed my hard work!": "joy", "I was so blissful after the births of both my girls. Such a sense of peace and relief on both a mental and physical level!": "joy", "I wish I could relate. I'm a male, so I'll never know the pain and/or the reward that comes with growing a human being inside your body. It's such an impressive thing to go through, and no matter what, mothers will never get enough credit. You deserve serious props. What ages are they now?": "joy", "15 and 19! It hasn't always been blissful, as any relationship's journey can attest to! But still a blessing. And maybe one day you'll be a dad...?": "sadness", "Yeah, I'll consider it. That's a nice thought. My brothers have had 5 kids between them, so I have plenty of nieces and nephews to deal with in the meantime, and they've given me lots of practice, but I'm grateful for that. 15 and 19, that's awesome. You're almost all the way through getting both of them to a stage where your job becomes a little easier.": "joy", "Ah, make the most of your nieces + nephews! You get to be the fun/cool/understanding uncle -- someone maybe a little more objective to turn to (depending on age!)": "joy", "Seems like every time we get a bill and I think I know how much it is, it": "joy", "It what?  Its way higher?  If that's what you meant to finish with then I totally feel you.  Especially during the summer with the air conditioning running so much.  ": "sadness", "Yes, that's exactly what I was trying to say haha hit enter too early. I thought we had lowered the electric use but boy was I wrong!": "anger", "It is ridiculous.  I found out how they measure power that people use in their houses and it doesn't even sound fair to me.  It averages things because it can't specifically tell. ": "disgusted", "The start of school for my 2 teenagers is less than a week away!": "trust", "Wow, school is right around the corner": "sadness", "It is! We actually got everything they need and more, except for a few notebooks. ": "joy", "Well that should relieve some stress": "anger", "The other day I was just having a really off day. Just couldn't get my mind and body to work right.": "sadness", "Everyone has those kinds of days, it happens": "sadness", "It does but I'm sure the people at the busy store thought I was drunk. I ran into everything, shelves, displays and even the door when I was leaving. ": "sadness", "I am sure they have forgotten about it": "sadness", "really didnt want to anything for days": "sadness", "Why not? What was wrong?": "fear", "I studied really hard all night infact but when my results came, i had nothing to show for it\".": "joy", "Aww I'm sorry. That's a bummer.": "sadness", "it is indeed. wont happen again though": "sadness", "I was attending a conference and heard the minister speak. he spoke with such grace that i was proud to be from that district\".": "joy", "It sounds very motivational.": "surprise", "it was. i always questioned how he got the position but it makes sense now": "sadness", "He must be a great speaker.": "surprise", "I feel uneasy because I don't know if I will be able to save enough money in time": "fear", "What are you saving for?": "joy", "Baby is due in less than 3 months": "joy", "I am sure everything will be fine. Do not stress.": "fear", "I worked hard all night for that exam. it takes 5 months to get the results back. the wait is killing me": "joy", "I hope you did well on it.": "joy", "5 months to find out !": "joy", "Just hope for the best and don't worry.": "fear", "I tried so hard for that exam, when i found out i got first! it was overwhelming!": "joy", "That's great!  I'm happy for you.": "joy", "thanks. now onto bigger things": "sadness", "What are those things?": "joy", "starting a clinic": "sadness", "it was the grand opening for our restaurant. The whole town was there. almost double the number of people we were expecting": "sadness", "That sounds so exciting! Congratulations!": "joy", "thanks. i think its an achivement of the whole town": "sadness", "It sounds like you live in a great community.": "trust", "I had no confidence and didn't have a girlfriend until age 22. I carried a lot of hatred towards girls because of this": "anger", "Oh man. Hopefully things are different now and you have the confidence that you need!": "joy", "Oh yes. It all changed when I directed what was inside towards the gym": "anger", "Nothing like taking it out on the weights and gaining the muscles in return! ": "joy", "I'm happy with my daily routine. I don't like change": "joy", "I understand that. I am the same way.": "sadness", "Especially when it comes to food. Like breakfast. I eat the same thing daily.": "trust", "I cannot function if I eat anything other than my usual breakfast.": "disgusted", "I can get fit in 3 months. Takes discipline ": "joy", "Unfortunately, I have very little discipline. I'm probably too addicted to carbs to get fit very quickly. ": "joy", "I eat plenty of carbs. It's all about timing": "joy", "the floods destroyed everything. The insurer is not returning our calls": "sadness", "wow. When that happened?": "sadness", "Last week. we're in temporary housing now": "anticipation", "Sorry to hear that. I hope your insurer will call you back soon.": "sadness", "I was just a kid but can't forget that day I left him alone in the rain. He should've just taken my hand!": "sadness", "It is unacceptable. I hope he did not get cold as a result of this": "sadness", "I don't know what happened to that kid to be honest.": "sadness", "That is pretty sad and heart-breaking to see kids in such situations": "sadness", "I recieved a call from my mother today.  She said she was in town.": "sadness", "Do you have plans to get together? ": "joy", "Yes she took me out to a restaurant and presented me with a book I had been wanting.": "surprise", "How nice of her. You must have been so happy to see her.": "trust", "I can't find another way to earn money": "anger", "There are usually many ways, but it depends on what you want to do!": "anticipation", "I just want to work from home": "sadness", "Well, we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us": "anger", "I can't wait for my baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now": "joy", "That is so exciting.  what have you done to prepare": "joy", "You know, not much to be honest. Just a few clothes and things. Need the buggy asap": "anger", "the buggy is important,  I have a baby boy of my own.": "fear", "I pray to God that every worry will be taken care of. Especially the baby essentials": "trust", "Do you have a baby one the way?": "trust", "I sure do. A baby boy. Less than 3 months to go now but it's hard saving up money. Just had a major car repair. It has set me way back": "joy", "do you make enough money to support the baby?": "trust", "She refused me but then a few days later I saw her and she was embarrassed of her lie. I was shorter and younger than the other guy.": "sadness", "oof that is rough.": "sadness", "Yeah. I put her through hell that school year. Made up all sorts of rumors ": "sadness", "those foids deserve it.": "anger", "I got angry when she refused. But I should've been more understanding": "anger", "Yes, you only hurt yourself when you get angry.": "sadness", "I shouldn't have forced the issue and so I promised never to ask again": "sadness", "Give it some time, maybe she'll change her mind.": "sadness", "I got my four year old daughter her first tricycle yesterday.": "joy", "thats so sweet of you": "trust", "She was having such a blast she went downhill and toppled over.  She took it like a champ but I was scared.": "fear", "oh yea i can imagine glad shes fine": "trust", "I did so much practice running in preparation for my 50 metre sprint race at my school!": "joy", "Wow. Do you expect to win?": "joy", "I do! I am so motivated to win and I believe I am one of the fastest at my school.": "joy", "That is nice. Good luck.": "joy", "I feel nostalgic when playing old school games with my bro": "sadness", "Nice, me too, are you playing Nintendo games?": "anticipation", "Yes and also Sega Genesis. We play these on the xbox one though via emulation": "sadness", "I remember these game well, like Contra and Battle Toads. ": "sadness", "I was so scared of going onto the train!": "fear", "Was it your first time riding on one? Is there something in particular that makes you afraid?": "fear", "No but I hate going in objects that travel fast, I really did not want to go on it.": "surprise", "Was it your only choice to get where you were going?": "fear", "I am going to get us a new car!": "joy", "Great, what make are getting?": "joy", "I'm not sure yet. Maybe a Toyota": "sadness", "Toyota is reliable, are getting an SUV?": "trust", "I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.": "sadness", "Interesting choice. Did she like it?": "surprise", "She loved it.  She's 17, I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.": "sadness", "That's good to have something in common. Make the memories.": "sadness", "I can't seem to feel happy but I'm not depressed": "sadness", "So what is the problem exactly?": "anger", "I just feel kinda stuck in life": "sadness", "Try doing something you never did before.": "anger", "I had pizza at a restaurant a couple days ago and found a hair on my pizza!": "disgusted", "It is disgusting. What did you do?": "disgusted", "I told the waited and demanded a refund! It was gross.": "disgusted", "You did good. You should have called the manager to tell him know.": "anger", "I finally got a new bike! I've been wanting one for so long!": "joy", "There are so many bike trails available now. You are going to have a lot of fun.": "joy", "I hope so, my new bike has so many gears. Such an upgrade from my last one! I can't wait to take it out.": "anger", "I'm glad you were able to get one that you are going to enjoy so much.": "sadness", "Pretty soon I'll be taking over my parents mortgage.  Homeownership is on the horizon.": "anticipation", "That's a big step. I hope it works out for you.": "joy", "A huge step. But I'm done with renting and I have a lot of renovating plans in the works.": "fear", "I like renovation projects. And yes, renting is a waste of money": "joy", "I'm the only one who cares about paying bills. It's very frustrating": "anger", "I feel you, I'm in the same boat.  Are you in a two income household?": "anticipation", "Unfortunately no. It's very hard on me because I have to be disciplined with spending. Makes life very boring": "sadness", "Yep, money spent on bills and food, with little left for fun.  My wife has the same complaint. ": "anger", "I have a beautiful gray cat named Stormy.  Unfortunately she's contracted feline AIDS.": "trust", "Oh no, that sounds horrible": "sadness", "Yep, she's pretty far gone now.  I now have to consider putting her down.": "sadness", "I am sorry, that is a sad thing to go through": "sadness", "I just got an assigment.  I was doing well on it but rushed through the very end.  Now I'm not sure I'll be paid.": "sadness", "Why would you not get paid?": "anger", "I can no longer prove I did the assignment.  Computer work is for the birds sometimes.": "joy", "I can imagine it is": "fear", "I found an old picture in a box of my Great Grandparents.": "sadness", "Oh my, did it make you emotional?": "sadness", "Not visibly.  It was a picture from their wedding day and it brought a smile to my face to see them so young.": "sadness", "Aw hopefully you never lose that picture!": "sadness", "I got a letter from my parents this past Friday with a wonderul surprise in it.": "surprise", "Oh what was the surprise?! ": "surprise", "Just a little spending cash.  Nothing outrageous, but enough to take the wife out and have a good time with.": "joy", "You should go on a little date if you can. or to the movies!": "sadness", "Last night I was walking home from work in a bad part of town, I was a bit scared.": "fear", "You should have taken a Uber. You never know what will happen these days.": "anger", "I agree. It was a bit foolish on my part and I don't want to risk myself nor be worried again. Thanks for the advice.": "fear", "No problem. Its also worth carrying a taser or pepper spray.": "surprise", "When I was 19 I stole money from a good friend in order to buy some food.  He asked me about it and I denied knowing anything.": "sadness", "did you pay him back?": "sadness", "No, I was going to but he said if he every found out I stole it, it wouldn't matter if I paid it back.  So I kept silent, its been 17 years now.": "sadness", "thats good thetn": "sadness", "I was one percent off from passing my math test, I was devastated.": "sadness", "Oh my, so close! But you can try better next time.": "sadness", "I agree, I should of studied harder too. Practice makes perfect!": "joy", "Yes and theres no point mulling over it! ": "sadness", "Last night I was minding my own business walking down a street in a not so good area of town when someone started to chase me!": "fear", "wow thats crazy.. what ended up happening!": "fear", "I managed to get away after a few smart quick turns, but I was shaking and in fear at the end of the chase. It was wild.": "fear", "wow thats good": "joy", "I was looking through old stuff in my basement and found my old baseball cards! Finding those was like being a kid all over again!": "sadness", "aww.. that must have been a sweet nostaligia. did you had a collection of those?": "sadness", "I used to collect so many when I was younger, it was such an awesome feeling to see them again!": "sadness", "I feel happy for ya!

Congrats!": "joy", "Oh, that was nearly 20 years ago ;-) But I'll always remember that Chicago day, Halloween, visiting the Shedd Aquarium with friends.": "sadness", "Oh, lol. Did you get to see any sharks at the aquarium?": "fear", "The thing I most remember were the beluga whales. So beautiful, in their own weird way -- and a baby beluga had just been born. It seemed provident!": "sadness", "Oh cool, yes that is very interesting. So how big were those whales in feet and the baby too?": "surprise", "The horror film I saw last night can cause nightmares. It was so scary!": "fear", "I know how you feel! What did you watch?": "sadness", "I ended up watching The Ring! It was ridiculousness.": "fear", "It is a pretty good horror.": "fear", "My daughter was accepted into Harvard. She starts in the fall.": "joy", "That is very impressive. She going to make sooo much money": "surprise", "She worked so hard and it's really expensive so I hope so!": "joy", "Any employer would hire someone who went to Harvard in a heartbeat. You are a lucky parent!": "joy", "My friend purchased a new car. The ride is sweet!": "surprise", "Nice what kind of car is it they purchased?": "surprise", "They ended up getting a Honda Prelude.": "joy", "Ok that is a nice car what color is it?? ": "anger", "I graduated college recently. I'm so glad!": "joy", "That is excellent, what did you major in?": "joy", "I majored in environmental engineering!": "joy", "Oh cool. Do you want to work as a scientist?": "joy", "I cheated on my girlfriend recently. I feel horrible about myself right now.": "sadness", "Sorry to hear about that.  I wonder if there's any way to fix this situation.  What do you plan to do?": "anger", "I plan on coming clean at some point, but I'm not sure how to break the news.": "sadness", "Coming clean is a great way to start.  It's hard since you know she'll be hurt.  Were you having trouble in the relationship before?": "sadness", "I can not wait until some of my family come in to town. They will be coming in to town in two weeks.": "anticipation", "When is the last time you seen them?": "joy", "I saw them last summer which seems so long ago. I am very excited to see them because I am very close to them.": "joy", "That's awesome I hope yall have a good time!": "joy", "I often get nostalgic when I think back to my high school years. I had some very good friends.": "sadness", "Do you still talk with any of your older friends?": "sadness", "Yes, I talk with several of them. I wish I had time to keep up with and talk to more though.": "sadness", "Do you have little time from working or other things?": "sadness", "I saw a horror film last night! It was such a scary experience!": "fear", "Yikes what was it about?": "fear", "A young girl would come out of the TV if you watched a video.": "surprise", "creepy.  Were you able to fall asleep after watching it?": "fear", "I am not really a sentimental person but I always feel so special when my husband takes me back to the place we spent our anniversary": "sadness", "That's great. I bet it is a very special place for you two.": "joy", "Yes, it is a very private Bed and Breakfast and we try to go back as often as we can.": "joy", "Sounds like a nice little place. I am glad you two have that spot to share.": "sadness", "I was devastated when I recently had to my chihuahua Riley to sleep.  She had Congestive Heart Failure.": "sadness", "at least Riley passed in their sleep. Hopefully they didn't suffer. i'm sorry you lost a loved one.": "sadness", "Thank you.  She was my constant companion.  I loved her so much": "sadness", "i have a big doofy mutt who is a 75 lb lap dog in his heart. i know the feeling": "joy", "I can not believe that Donald Trump became President. It just goes to show you that anyone can become President in the United States.": "disgusted", "I absolutely agree. I really hope he doesn't win in 2020.": "anticipation", "We shall see. I truly believe that he has done some much damage to our country in so many different ways.": "sadness", "He's like an angry child trying to make everything about himself!": "anger", "Once I was suppose to go visit my sister and nieces who I hadn't seen in forever but I ended up breaking my heal and big toe and wasn't able to go. I was so upset!": "sadness", "Dang, that sucks. MAybe they can visit you instead?": "sadness", "Yeah, hopefully so.  It isn't healing correctly is the problem or else I would just go in my cast.": "sadness", "Ah, gotcha. Well I hope you heal fast!": "sadness", "Over the summer my family went to Alabama to visit family and I felt a lot of emotions": "sadness", "I guess you don't live in Alabama? Was it overall a good trip....or challenging? Or both!": "joy", "No, I do not live in Alabama. We drove and trip was overall very good as sometimes it can be challenging when driving such a long distance": "joy", "Well, if the drive was the most challenging it sounds like a good trip! Too often it's family dynamics that are *more* challenging -- and not so easily taken care of. ;-)": "joy", "I was recently working on a project where unfortunately, my teammate really didn't pull their weight.": "joy", "That is the worst!! I know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate.": "anger", "Yep. Especially when you feel that you get dinged for the overall project. And at the same time, you don't want to complain about it, because it makes *you* look bad!": "sadness", "There have been a number of times where this has happened to me too. I hope that doesn't happen to you too much in the future!! :)": "anticipation", "I found out yesterday that I have a nest of yellow jacket bees in my front yard. They can be so aggressive.": "disgusted", "I hate bees and wasps so much. Maybe you should call pest control?": "disgusted", "I will be able to take control of it myself as I have done so in the past. It still makes it difficult because I can not mow the grass until it gets taken care of.": "sadness", "That sucks, I hope you get it figured out!": "sadness", "Since that earthquake in the early hours of the morning I realized how badly off I would be if I didn't get an emergency packet together. So that's what I did - cash, water, important documents, a change of clothing.": "sadness", "wow, it must have been quite an experience": "joy", "It was enough to wake me, but not the cat, lol. It just made me realize that the Big One could happen any time and I would have been up the proverbial creek!": "sadness", "My prayers are with you buddy. Stay safe": "sadness", "Thank you, I will. It's just the price you pay to live in Paradise, right! At least now I won't die of thirst.": "joy", "I went back to a horse ranch where I owned horses over 20 years ago. Good times": "sadness", "Awesome. What breed did you own?": "joy", "A paint (Black and white) and a red quarter horse ": "sadness", "I love paints, and growing up we had 2 quarter horses that my dad used for calf roping.": "sadness", "Horses are hard work but the fun is equal to the work. ": "joy", "The other day I had a flat, but I had my floor jack and 4-way lug wrench in my trunk and was able to get my tire changed and get back on the road within 10 minutes.": "anger", "10 minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire. I do not think I could change a tire own my own. ": "trust", "I've had so many flats in my life I've gotten quick at changing them.": "surprise", "Practice makes perfect, or makes you fast in your case.": "joy", "One time, my friends were daring me to jump into a very cold spring from a height of around 40 feet. I was nervous, naturally.": "fear", "I would be too! Did you to it?": "fear", "Yeah, I ended up doing it. I jumped in and missed a rock wall by probably 2 feet. My legs went numb from the cold as soon as I landed.": "sadness", "So did you regret doing it? Or were you super proud that you did? ": "sadness", "My dear friend Kris just started a job at a gorgeous golf resort on the shores of Lake Michigan. The green-eyed monster in me wants sooo badly to be there!": "surprise", "You must be so proud!": "joy", "I am, but it's so gorgeous and it's a fantastic golf course. And I'm stuck here, bored stupid! I know, I'm being selfish.": "sadness", "I don't think you're being selfish, you're doing your best!": "sadness", "I'm trying. Thank you for making me feel better - I really do wish him great success and happiness.": "joy", "I'm so excited about an upcoming move and life change -- it's a move to a verrrry different state, but should be interesting!": "anticipation", "What state are you going to move to?": "sadness", "Potentially Alaska -- Anchorage, to be specific. We've lived in different places before -- Amsterdam, Zurich, and Hong Kong. And even though it's a US state, it feels foreign somehow!": "joy", "Oh that is nice, will you be going skiing?": "joy", "I feel so relaxed and at peace when I meditate ": "joy", "Who doesn't..  everyone should do it!  Have you ever had any mystic experiences while you did it?": "sadness", "No mystic events. I just feel really relaxed and happy. ": "joy", "I hear you can travel to different dimensions while meditating..": "trust", "My traveling is more like a sleep / trance, or hypnosis ": "fear", "Once, I thought somebody was attempting to break into my house.": "fear", "It must have being terrifying!": "fear", "Yes, I was truly frightened. It ended up being okay though. It was actually just a roofer inspecting my roof that nobody told me about.": "fear", "Tnank god! They should have let you know they where going to do the job.": "anger", "I felt so let down by a person who promised me a project -- but then pulled it away at the last minute in a way that was very personal and reactionary.": "sadness", "That's terrible. People need to learn to commit to their promises.": "anger", "Especially when it's based on emotion versus honoring a commitment. And when they know it has a very real economic impact.": "joy", "I don't understand how so many people value emotion over logic and reason!": "sadness", "I had to give a presentation in front of my entire University class last semester. I hate presenting things.": "joy", "oh, that is nerve wracking. What did you try to do to cope?": "fear", "Honestly, I took a xanax beforehand. It was a group presentation also which helped take some of the spotlight off of me.": "trust", "Better living through chemistry! I'm glad you made it through.": "joy", "I went to the local Farmers Market and bought some produce from a farm stall. I am disabled and the kind farmer, despite being busy with other customers, took the time to take my purchases to my car. What a wonderful, kind man!": "joy", "That is really nice of him.  Did the other people get mad because they had to wait?": "surprise", "Not at all. They were super nice, and just kept getting together what they wanted to buy. I love living here - such nice people.": "surprise", "Lucky you.  Where I live people are not so nice.  Can I move there?": "joy", "Sure! There's plenty of room, lol. Just be sure you like hot, steamy summers and lots of golf fanatics!": "joy", "I am in Central FL... so uhh.": "joy", "I get your point - used to live in NE Florida myself. Well, this farmer fella is going to get lots of business from me, that's for sure.": "joy", "I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.": "anger", "Ouch, I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.": "sadness", "Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck": "anger", "Hmm, wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!": "anger", "Maybe I should bring a can of wasp spray!": "fear", "So I work at a UPS Store. I once gave a customer the wrong package that was valued at $700.": "trust", "Luckily, they were customers that we knew really well and they had a mailbox at our store. So they brought it back when we explained what happened. I felt awful though.": "sadness", "But at least you lucked out and they brought it back!": "sadness", "I've been reminiscing recently about the good old days, when I was a kid and didn't have to worry about bills and expenses.": "sadness", "Ah, I know what you mean! And remember *yearning* to be older?! (And of course the adults in *our* lives were shaking their heads, thinking the way we are now ;-))": "sadness", "Yes! I wished so much that I would be an adult so I could make my own decisions. Now I wish I could have someone else make those decisions for me! haha": "trust", "As long as you keep your playful spirit, you're in good shape! Sometimes it takes work to hold that awareness, but I can see it in you!": "joy", "I love what I do because it's about both inspiring and empowering people to be their best and to excel at their jobs.": "joy", "It's awesome to have a job where you feel rewarded through what you do. What do you do?": "joy", "I work as a facilitator and team trainer -- mostly with a company who I truly love and respect for walking their talk.": "surprise", "That sounds like a lot of fun, it's so rewarding to have a position where you can engage with other people. You really seem motivating and inspiring, so I'm happy you have that job!": "joy", "I waited for a good friend of mine at a local pub recently - 2 hours I waited. Eventually I got hold of him and he said he couldn't be bothered going out and had forgotten to call. Not too impressed, frankly.": "trust", "What did you do after waiting for 2 hours?": "joy", "I bought a pint of beer and a curry and joined another single woman at a table. We had a fine time, but I sure am wondering about my friendship!": "sadness", "Silver linings do happen, maybe is was a good thing your friend forgot about you.": "sadness", "Could be. I just feel he was being rather inconsiderate, which is not something I'd expect of him.": "anger", "Maybe not a true friend after all.": "sadness", "Kind of what I was thinking. I won't be arranging to meet him again for a while, that's for sure!": "joy", "I was so envious of my friend when she won from a lottery ticket she bought for a buck.": "anger", "I bet. How much did she win and did she offer to share?!": "surprise", "She won $5,000 and never offered to share. ": "trust", "That's a lot of money, to me anyway. Perhaps she's got a lot of debt to pay off, or perhaps she has kids to take care of?": "sadness", "I recently aced a circuits exam that I was very confident in.": "joy", "Good job! You must have worked hard and prepared. Or are you just naturally really smart?": "joy", "I wouldn't say naturally smart, it took a good amount of planning to do well. We established a study group about 2 weeks before the test which helped alot.": "joy", "Well done! You should be proud.": "joy", "I am anticipating that the limestone mine in my area where I live at will be reclaimed.": "anticipation", "If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?": "sadness", "Clean up, stabilize from future collapses, demolish vacant houses open closed roads, and so on": "anticipation", "Wow, that's fantastic news indeed! How long has it been derelict?": "joy", "I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am, I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex). Suddenly, out of the darkness, appeared a tall bulky figure dressed in black. They were coming straight at me!": "fear", "What did they or the person do to you?": "sadness", "Well, I'm in a wheelchair, so can't move too quickly. I just sat looking at them, trying to figure out whether I could reach the broom at the corner of the porch.": "sadness", "Broom would be a good choice, hit them in the crotch, that will stop them.": "anger", "Well, that would have been an option. The person came right up to my porch and said \"Good morning. Can't sleep either?\" It was my friend and neighbor walking her dog and I didn't recognize her with all her winter gear on. Scared the daylights out of me!": "anger", "My daughter just got married and moved across the country and is homesick. I've been talking to her every day to make her feel better.": "sadness", "That's sweet. I'm sure she will adjust in time. Have you ever personally had to make a move like your daughter did?": "sadness", "Actually, I did! I moved across the world to Doha, Qatar to teach for a couple of years. Even though my husband and daughter was with me, it was very hard to be away. Have you ever moved far away?": "sadness", "No, I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However, I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.": "sadness", "I had to give a presentation in front of my college class and it didn't go so well.": "sadness", "Oh no! I hate speaking in front of crowds. What happened?": "fear", "There was a lot of stuttering and red-face going on. Also, technical difficulties.": "surprise", "I know you probably feel like you did a bad job- but I bet you did so much better than you think! Be proud of yourself for having the nerve to speak in front of others!": "fear", "Sometimes when people honk in traffic I don't know whether to get angry or be glad!": "anger", "Honking is a way to communicate. In some countries they honk just to let another driver they are there.": "anger", "Exactly, I think a lot of people are too cautious while driving, which makes things even less safe ": "fear", "Going too slow can be just as dangerous as going too fast. Especially in the fast lane!": "anger", "I recently got accepted to an Electrical Engineering program at my school.": "joy", "That awesome! Congratulations! You should be very proud of yourself!": "joy", "I was very excited when I found out. Have you ever been accepted to anything that you really wanted before?": "joy", "Yes, I have! It's a great feeling when all of your hard work pays off! Best of luck to you!": "joy", "I was really frightened the other night. I was home alone and there was a big storm.": "fear", "There is a big storm coming where I am living now. Did your power go out?": "joy", "Fortunately, it didn't, but there was a LOT of thunder and lightning. I think a lot of places are being hit by storms right now. Please stay safe!": "fear", "Oh I will. Also wanted to let you know that if your power does go out to be aware that this is when they come out to play!": "joy", "I was quite distressed to hear of the passing of Anthony Bourdain. That someone who has given so much joy to a huge number of people should take his own life is just awful.": "sadness", "I know!  I was just watching his show on Netflix!  So sad, especially since he had a little girl he is leaving behind.": "sadness", "Indeed. Depression is a terrible disease and there simply aren't enough resources devoted to mental illness, imo.": "trust", "I agree.  He had so much to live for.  I guess it is hard to know what demons people are hiding inside.": "sadness", "It is. I read his book Kitchen Confidential. He's been battling addiction and demons all his life. I thought he'd found peace, but I guess not.": "sadness", "My work supervisor came into my store recently. I tucked in my shirt, left home early, and even put my name badge on for the special occasion.": "trust", "That is good. Did you have a good time with your supervisor?": "joy", "I had a great time keeping my job and not being fired! I was on the ball for his visit.": "sadness", "Good job! Maybe you will get a promotion too!": "joy", "I am going to my local amusement park tomorrow and feeling a certain way about it!": "joy", "Which way are you feeling? Are you a thrill seeker?": "trust", "I am indeed. I am ready to go and ride all of the rides, roller coasters especially! Do you have a favorite theme park?": "joy", "Yeah I really like Six Flags. They have some great roller coasters. Have fun tomorrow!": "joy", "I recently started putting part of my paychecks into a savings account. I have almost $1000 now.": "trust", "Keep it up. Soon you'll have enough money to buy a new house.": "sadness", "That may take awhile, but for the moment I have a nice emergency fund and am prepared for whatever may come my way.": "joy", "Exactly, it feels great when your prepared for the unexpected.": "joy", "We all were excited when my sister came home for Christmas. She brought her whole family.": "surprise", "That's fun. Will anybody be dressing as Santa?": "joy", "Haha! Nobody ever dresses as Santa, but the kids still believe in Santa which is very fun.": "sadness", "Maybe you could pay someone to come into your house as Santa! And all the kiddies will be amazed!": "sadness", "I was very upset when I came home to find that my dog had torn up my living room sofa.": "anger", "that happened to me one. i had an american bulldog that had seperation anxiety and tore up my sofa cushions once. it was like a fluffy murder scene when i got home.": "surprise", "That's horrible, but looking back in the future it will be funny hopefully. My dog I thought had been trained, but she clearly had not!": "sadness", "oh no. right now you are going crazy but it will be funny like you said in the future.": "sadness", "I think tv shows make me into a mushy person at times.": "sadness", "What types of tv shows do you like to watch?": "joy", "Everything really, I just know I'm going to cry if it's sad even if I've seen it before.": "sadness", "Do you keep the tissue close whenever your are on the tv?": "sadness", "Nah, I don't get to to bad.": "sadness", "I am very much looking forward to going to Busch Gardens next week with my family!": "anticipation", "Ive been to Busch Gardens before.  They have some really cool Roller coasters.  I hope you have a great time.": "fear", "I do too. Did you go to the one in Williamsburg or in Tampa? ": "anger", "Ive been to the one in Tampa.  They have this new coaster that rotates forward and backward and spins around. It was equal parts fun and scary.": "fear", "Little kids really have no clue about germs I think.": "sadness", "Yea, I agree. Or they just really don't care.": "sadness", "This kid dropped his candy bar and then picked it up and ate it.": "sadness", "Did he even hesitate?": "trust", "Not even a little.": "sadness", "What a little monster!": "surprise", "I can not believe how loyal my dogs are to me. I am so thankful that they will let me give medicine to them without putting up a fight.": "trust", "Dogs are the best. are they ok?  what kind of medicine do you have to give them?": "trust", "Well, right now they both have an ear infection. Both of them are Golden Retrievers and they both are very gentle dogs that let me administer medicine without any problems": "trust", "Awww golden retrievers are adorable.  My ex had one of them.  Well I hope your dogs feel better soon.  Ear infections are no fun at all.": "trust", "I had a storm come through recently. A massive limb fell on top of my roof and now I have to replace the entire roof of my house": "sadness", "That's intense! I hope the damage wasn't all that bad.": "fear", "It was very bad. The entire roof will definitely have to be replaced.": "sadness", "Yes, get it fixed as soon as possible. Does insurance cover it?": "trust", "Yes, insurance will cover it thankfully. I am very lucky.": "trust", "I went to a wedding. I saw many of my friends from my grade school past.": "sadness", "Wow, you remember your friends from grade school? Maybe if I saw them again those memories would come back.": "sadness", "Yes I do. Some of them I am still very fond of.": "sadness", "Well, I hope you had a really great time. It sounds like you probably did!": "sadness", "I can't wait for my family to come to town. My house is all in order for when they come.": "anticipation", "That sounds like fun, do you have a big family?": "joy", "No, I really don't so it's special. I would have what many would call a nuclear family, you know?": "sadness", "Yes I understand, I have a big family so it's hard for us to all get together at the same time.": "sadness", "I went to my friend's niece's dance recital this weekend. I could not believe how well she did.": "joy", "Ive never been to one of those.  Is she really young or is she like a professional dancer?": "surprise", "She is very young, and she stole the show. She was hilarious and stood out from all of the rest of the girls.": "surprise", "thats awesome.  I wish I would have taken dancing lessons when I was younger.  Im a horrible dancer": "sadness", "You know you could still do it. I know you can.": "sadness", "yea you're right.  Maybe ill look into some classes and give it a shot": "sadness", "My son drove down and spent the whole weekend helping me move.": "sadness", "Aw, that's so nice of him! Does he live far away?": "trust", "He lives about a couple hours away, but he's young and always busy. I was very relieved to have some help as it was a BIG job!": "joy", "That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed": "trust", "You know sometimes when you just feel like you have to leave a job? Well, that time is now for me and I can not wait for my job interview this week.": "sadness", "Yeah I have had that experience. One was so bad I left before getting another job. Don't recommend doing that, lol.": "fear", "It is so tempting you're absolutely right. I'm going to try and hang on though, and thanks for the advice.": "sadness", "Stick it out until you have a backup. Your bank account will thank you!": "sadness", "I found a salad in the back of my refrigerator that I forgot about. It smelled awful when I opened the container it was in.": "disgusted", "Gross. It would have gone straight into the trash here.": "fear", "Yes, it went straight to the outside trash container. I was very surprised that my entire refrigerator didn't smell bad.": "disgusted", "You can use baking soda to get the smell out of it.": "disgusted", "Thanks for that information. I'll try it out.": "joy", "Last year my sister opened up her own retail store. It is doing very well, and I love going to see it.": "surprise", "That sounds wonderful! What type of store is it?": "joy", "It has a lot of quirky things that most Big Box stores don't carry. It has everything from clothes for all ages, to jewelry and lots of other things.": "joy", "I love that! It must be so much fun to curate the types of things that go in to the store. Do you help out or work there?": "joy", "I have another job so I can't do too much, but I love going in to see her. ": "sadness", "I'm sure she *loves* having both your presence and your support!": "sadness", "I felt very isolated when we first moved to Hong Kong -- I had a young baby and my husband pretty much needed to start traveling for business right away!": "sadness", "Wow, I can't imagine how you felt living in Hong Kong. That would take some serious adapting.": "fear", "It did! But there was a very vibrant and concentrated expat community -- that helped immediately!": "joy", "I am so happy that you found that expat community. I have often thought about moving abroad, and I'm glad that you adapted well.": "joy", "Do it! It gives such a wonderful perspective on the world. We've lived in Amsterdam and Zurich as well....and may very well move to Anchorage soon!": "joy", "I think I might. It sound exciting, and I thank you for the encouragement.": "anticipation", "I recently got very sick, and I had to spend a lot of time in the hospital. I am very lucky that I have a great family that watched over me.": "trust", "That's unfortunate, but I'm happy that you have a good support network to help you out.": "trust", " Not a day goes by where I'm not thankful. I'm still recovering and they are still there for me.": "trust", "I hope you recover well and I'm sure you will with good support by your side.": "fear", "I find it profoundly sad and disturbing how some people will rationalize someone else's unhinged behavior, simply to avoid admitting that maybe they made a horrible choice.": "disgusted", "I completely understand that. Did something like that happen recently? ": "sadness", "We're living with it. And it's dividing us as a society. I truly hope that the upcoming months will bring big change. Definitely working for that!": "anticipation", "Yes, I know how you feel. All we can do is encourage friends to join us in helping to make a difference. I believe there is hope!": "anticipation", "Me too! <fist bump> ;-)": "fear", "So yesterday I found out my roommate has been dating someone for 3 months. I can't believe he didn't tell me.": "sadness", "Wow, that's a good amount of time. Is he usually so secretive?": "joy", "He is usually a very private person. He hasn't dated anyone in the over 3 years i've lived here, and he's only ever had one friend over.": "sadness", "Ah, maybe he just wanted to make sure it was going to work before he told anyone. ": "sadness", "I got so annoyed the other day. Got cut off in traffic.": "anger", "It should be harder to get a license than it is.": "anger", "I agree! Do people just not care about risking their own lives never mind anyone else?": "anger", "It's as if some people think they are the only one's on the road.": "anger", "You know my parents still have not gotten over the loss of my sister.": "sadness", "Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. May I ask how long ago it was that she passed? ": "sadness", "She passed two days after Christmas. She was very sick during the whole month of December.": "sadness", "They probably still just need some time. My grandfather still isn't over the passing of my grandmother and that was over a year ago. I would just make sure to keep seeing and talking to your parents to make them feel as loved as you can.": "sadness", "I will, and thank you so much for the encouragement.": "anticipation", "I've been passively job hunting for a few months now, looking for a better job. I haven't had any luck yet and I'm starting to feel like I never will.": "fear", "Please don't ever give up. I would definitely work harder to find a job by networking with friends that have jobs in different places.": "joy", "Well I don't have any friends that are in my field or even close to it. I'm trying the best I can and am trying to find other ways to make money too. ": "sadness", "Go ahead and post your resume on as many job related forums that you can. I think it's great that you're trying to find other ways of making money too. You are a go-getter, and don't ever give up!!": "anticipation", "One of my much younger sister's is starting college in a couple weeks. I am so excited for her.": "joy", "That is awesome. Do you know what she wants to study?": "joy", "She told me she wants to become a dentist, but she's a little fickle. I will see what she says she wants to do in a year.

I must have been absolutely nuts when I did it.": "surprise", "Oh I don't think I could do that. I have a fear of falling from high places. ": "fear", "It gave me the biggest rush that's for sure. But on the way down I was saying my prayers.": "fear", "I think I would pass out from fear lol.": "fear", "You should do it sometime.

I wanted to do everything I could to be there for her.": "trust", "That's terrible to hear. Were you eventually able to be there?": "sadness", "I was and she was had a full recovery. ": "trust", "That's great news. I don't know what I would do if my mom passed.": "joy", "Me neither, my mom means so much to me. ": "sadness", "Me too. I'm glad everytihng worked out in the end for you.": "trust", "Do you get to see your mom often?": "sadness", "Not very often. She lives about 7 hours away driving time.": "sadness", "I saw a dodge viper in the parking lot yesterday. Probably one of the coolest American made cars!": "surprise", "Those cars are pretty slick, what color was it?": "anger", "It was blue with white racing stripes. ": "surprise", "Wow, one day I hope to have enough money for a car like that, that's awesome": "joy", "Same here, they are pretty expensive.

Now I have to throw them out.": "anger", "UGH my dog has destroyed all of my favorite shoes.": "anger", "This is the first one she tore up. My roommate was watching her while I was out of town.

": "anger", "it happens to the best of us, and i totally understand where your coming from , spend some time with your friends or loved ones ": "sadness", "My grandfather invited me over and made us an awesome dinner today. I was so hungry. ": "sadness", "What did he cook that is such an exciting way to spend your day with your papa.": "surprise", "He made us a pot roast with carrots and potatoes.

You have some generous parents.": "trust", "So yesterday I went for a bike ride in my city's park. The weather was perfect!": "joy", "Very nice, wind in your hair, exercise, and fresh air.  Did you have a good time?": "joy", "It was wonderful. I felt at peace as I rode by all of the flower gardens and fountains. Do you visit any parks or gardens in your area?": "joy", "I am actually home bound, but I love to live through other peoples experiences.  My wife and kids go out and bring back stories of their adventures.  I love it!": "trust", "It's so quiet in my house, just watching tv by myself. Wish my family was around.": "sadness", "I know how you feel.  I moved away from my family and friends this summer.  Do you have family nearby at all? I often feel lonely when I'm watching a movie by myself but then I remind myself that I'm loved by a lot of people.": "sadness", "That is a great attitude to have, my husband is in the military so he is gone a lot to other countries. My family is about 2,000 miles away in Alaska!": "joy", "You are so strong!  Please thank your husband for his service and thank you for being his support, no matter the miles between you.

I'm 24.": "surprise", "Oh wow, I'd be really jealous of him.": "anger", "I certainly am! Of course, I can't be certain yet because I don't know what he's getting. My car is junk though so it's bound to be better.": "sadness", "Well, hopefully you can get yourself a better car soon.": "sadness", "So my brother is turning 16 soon which means I don't have to drive him around anymore.

I actually moved to the other side of the USA, and I do miss my home": "sadness", "Are you able to visit often? That helps -- but it's funny how things never feel *exactly* the same, you know?": "sadness", "Not as often as I would like. Air travel is expensive after all. I know exactly what you mean though!": "anger", "I went to a bar a couple days ago and was hit on by a woman. ": "sadness", "Were you happy about that, or creeped out?": "fear", "I respectfully told her I was not interested, I already have a wife so I need to be committed. I would never cheat.": "trust", "You're a good guy. Did she take it well?": "trust", "I recently attended a play.

I know this isn't the best solution, but have you considered listening to funny podcasts?": "anger", "No I haven't, but that's a decent idea that I may try. Thanks for the suggestion!": "fear", "No problem! I know you can't always fix everything, but it's worth trying wierd ideas every now and then": "sadness", "So I recently made buffalo wing sauce from a new recipe I found and it turned out great!": "joy", "Oh wow, I love that kind of sauce": "joy", "Me too! It only took 10 minutes to make and now I feel way more sure of myself when making it next time.": "sadness", "That isnt long at all": "anger", "I recently completed some additional training at my job. Perhaps a promotion is on its' way?": "joy", "It is always good to keep our skills up to date. We never know. It could also help for a promotion also.": "trust", "Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.": "sadness", "I hope you get your promotion.": "joy", "I am so excited for my baby son to be born, I am so eager for it to happen!": "anticipation", "Oh man, your life is about to get so much more hectic. I feel for you. When my first was born, I was just as pumped, full of naivety and positivity. I felt like I could take on anything coming my way. I was exhausted after two weeks. It's such a long ride until they're able to even remotely look after themselves.": "joy", "I know! Hopefully the stress levels are kept to a minimal and I have a very supporting husband who will be there every step of the way. I hope for a swift and trouble free birth.": "joy", "I know you have a lot of work ahead of you, but I'm sure it will be a rewarding feeling that will be unmatched for the rest of your life. As a man, I can't imagine what you'll have to go through, or what you will enjoy, but I really commend all women everywhere for the strength they give when having a child.": "joy", "So last night I was watching scary videos on youtube while home alone.": "fear", "Did it scare you?": "fear", "Yes, I had kind of an eerie and generally unsettling feeling. I wondered why I did that in the first place. Can you relate?": "sadness", "Yes, a little bit. When I was young, I didn't like that much scary movies.": "fear", "I'm ready for football season to start, NFL preseason started this week, and I can't wait for regular season and I'm really looking forward to the NCAA kickoff!": "anticipation", "Whats your favorite team?": "anticipation", "In NFL it's the Packers and college is Alabama": "joy", "Well for me, in the NFL I like the Cowboys and college its Alabama too.": "anticipation", "I visited the BMX park today and saw someone doing a double front flip with their bike, it was insane!": "anger", "That's pretty cool. I bet it's pretty difficult to do something like that.": "sadness", "I agree, years of experience and a lot of guts are needed. You could easily get injured but he pulled it off. It was crazy to see it in person. It's the type of stuff you see on TV": "surprise", "I'd love to watch people do tricks like this in person myself, but I'm not sure if there's any locations near me.": "trust", "My car broke down yesterday but luckily my friend was able to pick me up from work while it was in the shop. I think I'm going to take him to a nice restaurant to say thanks.": "trust", "Aw I am sorry that happened to you. I hope the repair didn't cost you too much! ": "sadness", "It was just the carburetor, which is supposed to be an easy fix. I'm so glad I wasn't stranded at my office.": "trust", "Ah I see. Something similar happened to my brother too recently while he was picking me up, so we were stuck at a coffee shop parking lot for several hours. ": "anger", "I was so set on getting an A on my math test that I studied so hard to do good on it. I studied for days!": "joy", "Well at least you put in the effort. What grade did you end up receiving on this test?": "joy", "I ended up getting an A actually. It was exactly what I wanted to get.": "joy", "That's great! Hard work pays off I guess.": "joy", "My friend passed away in a car crash a couple days ago, I'm still in shock.": "sadness", "Oh I'm sorry.  How are his family doing?": "sadness", "They've been really closed up about the whole thing, I can't contact them or anything. They must be going through a tough time, I could not imagine.": "fear", "It's pretty hard to deal with.  One of my friend's buddies died in a car crash as well.": "sadness", "I realized yesterday I was pregnant, I was in shock!": "surprise", "Woah, that is huge news. How are you handling the news.": "fear", "I am still in awe, I think things will turn out fine but it was definitely not expected.": "surprise", "I am happy to hear that you will be ok. Enjoy having no kids while you can!": "joy", "When the weather was getting bad and it rained hard in our area, I was ready for the flooding that was going to happen in our neighborhood. ": "joy", "That does not sound fun. What did you do to prepare. ": "joy", "I had an emergency generator, extra food and first aid kits at the ready. I did not want my family in danger.": "joy", "That is very smart thinking!": "joy", "I stole a candy and drink from the gas station once, I felt terrible about the whole ordeal.": "sadness", "How old were you? If you were a kid, that deserves a pass!": "sadness", "I was 17, at that age I should of known better.": "sadness", "You live and you learn, at least it was a petty crime and nothing serious!": "anger", "My friend has had the flu, and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.": "trust", "That's sweet of you, the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!": "trust", "Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well, just whiny. ": "joy", "That's good, at least he is getting better, he'll survive!": "sadness", "I managed to get on the A honor roll at my school, I was a bit smug and happy for myself about the whole thing.": "joy", "There's nothing wrong with that": "fear", "I'm just happy that I got it, it took a lot of hard work.": "joy", "You should celebrate too. I would": "joy", "The last time I hung out with a group of friends before moving we watched this really terrible movie.": "sadness", "That is always disappointing. Did you have a good time with your friends anyway?": "sadness", "Yeah, it was fun.  We ended up making the best of it, making fun of the movie while it was on.": "joy", "Sounds like you guys know how to have fun no matter what. You have good friends. ": "trust", "I remember sitting in the waiting room before my last job interview.  I was sweating and couldn't stop my leg from shaking.": "fear", "I too feel the same. What did happen at last?": "sadness", "The interview went well and I ended up getting the job, so I guess I worried for nothing :)": "fear", "Yeah, very good to hear! congrats!": "joy", "The other day I had to take my dogs out before work, but my neighbor was right outside with her aggressive yappy dog smoking so I couldn't get out.": "trust", "Eww, I hate neighbors that have no class.": "disgusted", "She usually cares enough to at least time her cigarettes so they don't get in the way with things like work, but not this time.": "anger", "Maybe you should start a petition in the neighborhood to kick her out.": "sadness", "I was at a pizza joint and my chair leg broke and I fell to the floor. Everyone in the pizza place all was looking at me on the floor. My face was so red and the manager came over and helped me up.": "sadness", "How awful! Please tell me you can laugh a little about it now?": "sadness", "Now I can laugh, but when I was on the floor I was not laughing, I just wanted to leave.": "sadness", "Embarrassing things happen to all of us!": "sadness", "My son is 16 months and he finally learned how to use a spoon and a fork.

Where did you guys go?": "joy", "Lunch, a zoo, my apartment for a while, and a movie and dinner.  We just didn't want to go home for the night :P": "joy", "That sounds like a fun day! My wife and i used to go to movies a lot!": "joy", "Years ago my childhood beagle died from kidney failure.  I found him in the kitchen in the morning, he did not go easily :(": "sadness", "That's terrible.  Was he already very sick?": "sadness", "Yeah, he had diabetes for a few years by that point.  It was just a rough way to go and I hope it didn't take very long.": "sadness", "Im sorry he went through that.": "sadness", "I remember getting my first job and just working so hard for that first week cause it was retail": "joy", "Those were the days right. I loved those paychecks no bills.... can we go back to that? ": "sadness", "Oh man the thing that got me was waiting for the first check to come in though. Remember that? You're very FIRST one": "fear", "Yeah and I bet it was like a whole 100 or 200 bucks and we were probably feeling like a ceo. ": "sadness", "I realized that my bus that I ride to work in every day is a revamped school bus": "sadness", "How does that make you feel? Is that a dealbreaker": "sadness", "Oh god no thankfully I have fond memories of it. I just realized how cheap the company is! ": "sadness", "Ah, I guess you have to save money somewhere": "sadness", "I broke up with my girlfriend last week and it was really hard": "sadness", "Oh no I am sorry to hear about that, were you together long?": "sadness", "Yeah we where together for about 2 years but im getting over it now": "joy", "That's good make yourself available and open for others and you will find the next relationship": "sadness", "I was out at dinner with my family, and when coming back to the table from the bathroom I somehow accidentally sat down with a different family.": "sadness", "That is embarassing, but a good story at least!": "sadness", "Yeah, it certainly lead to a lot of good natured ribbing from my parents :P": "joy", "That is for sure, you can always count on parents for that": "trust", "We are getting our son to go back to college in a few days and it really made me stop and think back to him when he was smaller, and how time flies by so fast!": "sadness", "IT does go fast. I was just changing my daughters diaper and now she is in junior high!": "joy", "I know, that's about how I felt too! I think back to when he was much smaller and how adorable he was when he would call me mommy then!": "trust", "I miss being called mommy. One day you'll be called grandma": "sadness", "The last time I went to the fair, I tripped and fell. There were so many people around that saw me hit the ground. You can imagine how I felt!": "sadness", "that is embarassing, but were you at least okay?": "sadness", "I scuffed my knees a bit, but I was okay. I was also with a person that I really liked, so that made it even worse. But, I jumped up super quick lol": "sadness", "Well maybe they found that endearing in a way!": "sadness", "i stold some spare change from my parents": "trust", "How old were you when you did it?": "sadness", "maybe like 19, but i felt bad after so i invited them to dinner": "sadness", "That was nice to repay them back with dinner": "trust", "Yeah i told them as well": "sadness", "My sister passed away several years ago. I really had a hard time with the grief and couldn't really relate to anyone that tried to help me with it.": "sadness", "i'm sorry to hear that. i know exactly what you are going through. My brother tragically passed away 2.5 years ago. He was only 32": "sadness", "Yes, I'm sure you can relate as well. Ironically, that was the same age that my sister passed away. She took her own life, which my mother and I found her, and it was very hard for us all. But, I couldn't burden my parents with my pain, I felt.": "trust", "I know how hard it was for you. My parents and my brother lived in a different country so i couldn't even go there at that time to be with them. I felt heartbroken and alone": "sadness", "Having a good job is something to thank": "joy", "To thank whom?": "sadness", "to life God to that higher energy": "joy", "Is that who got you the job?": "joy", "Nobody ... that's why I'm grateful": "trust", "What job do you have?": "joy", "I'm an administrative assistant for a construction company": "anger", "Are you in a union?": "joy", "I was devastated when I lost my phone": "sadness", "did you find it ?": "sadness", "I did but it took a while ": "sadness", "well thats good": "joy", "I was surprised when my family threw me a surprise party": "surprise", "how old did you turn ?": "sadness", "I turned 34": "surprise", "congrats": "joy", "i didn't see my parents since 2014!

Sometimes they just don't get it, though.": "sadness", "Fortunately it's usually just not having the best answer for what they ask. I've learned and prepared a lot more this time.": "joy", "Wow, you sound pretty confident! You must really know what you're talking about.": "joy", "I tend to know a thing or two on occasion.": "surprise", "I am taking a long overdue and much needed vacation this week. I wish i didnt have to fly.": "anticipation", "I am afraid to fly too.": "fear", "I usually do pretty good on short flights. Longer ones make me a little nervous.": "joy", "I know right, planes make me nervous.": "fear", "I hate turbulence too.": "fear", "I didnt think to invite my sister to a party I recently helped put on.": "trust", "Uh oh. I bet she wasn't happy when she found out.": "sadness", "No she wasnt. In all fairness it was a group of people I never would have thought she would have wanted to hang out with.": "sadness", "Yeah, I can understand that.... But it probably would have been best to invite her anyway, just in case.": "sadness", "you are right. Guess I know better for next time.": "sadness", "My sunday was great. All my chores were done ahead of time. It was a rare and welcomed day.": "joy", "that is awesome. sundays are usually my veg out days.": "joy", "I wish I could more often, but it rarely happens. Especially during the summer. My yard grows like literal weeds.": "fear", "mine is going crazy with mosquitos": "anger", "ouch! I would not have had a relaxing sunday if my yard was that way.": "joy", "i tried to trim my tomato leaves yesterday but i got bit up so bad i ran back inside": "anger", "My husband has to travel a lot for work. It can be hard on a marriage, but after almost 23 years of marriage, I have faith he is loyal and faithful when he does.": "trust", "What does your husband do for work?": "joy", "He is an iron worker, so he has to go state to state at times to build very large buildings. ": "joy", "My uncle use to be an iron worker, so I know exactly what you are talking about.": "joy", "I've been married almost 23 years, but many years ago, my husband was acting a bit too \"chivalrous\" to a female acquaintance of ours. He said he was only being nice, but I felt he was being a bit 'too nice', which made me feel a bit upset. ": "sadness", "That is VERY understandable. Emotional affair is still a betrayal. ": "sadness", "Well, we really didn't know her very well and she actually just came to one of our friends house while we were there, and she was intoxicated. He was trying to help her get up and situated, but he was very insistent about it, even when she didn't want help. It looked bad to others.": "sadness", "Well it's nice he is kind but yes that is a little strange. Women can usually take that as something and try to get with your man. ": "sadness", "My niece is super talented lately.": "joy", "What is her best talent?": "surprise", "Art, she was accepted into a special program for high school.": "joy", "Does she draw or paint? How any students are in this program?": "anger", "Mostly drawing. And she's in advanced level classes in most subjects.": "joy", "One day my 10 year old daughter came home crying after she got off the bus. A teenage boy purposely tripped her as she was getting off and she got hurt. Needless to say, I was very, very upset!": "sadness", "That is terrible.  I don't know why teenage boys can be so mean.  What did you end up doing?": "anger", "I actually knew his father, so I called and spoke to him about it. I let him know that if it happened again, I couldn't promise her big brother wouldn't take it in his own hands to defend her, as he wasn't okay with anyone bullying her.": "sadness", "That's good that she has a big brother that can defend her against the bigger kids.  It is just terrible that a teenage boy would act that way to a 10 year old.  No excuse for that.  I hope you don't have to deal with it again, though.": "anger", "I really dont like my husbands job right now.": "sadness", "I'm sorry, what is his job?": "sadness", "Retail, but he's working nights at a store really far away and it sucks": "sadness", "Hopefully they will give him a better shift.": "trust", "We are hoping with in a few months.": "anticipation", "Each year my husband usually gets a bonus this month or next.

What are you planning to buy with it?": "joy", "Well, we have college tuition, just got back from an expensive beach vacation, etc. So, if anything replenish some savings, right!": "joy", "That's an awesome, very adult thing to do!  Congrats!": "joy", "I hate watching movies that are full of gore! I just saw one today and so gross!": "disgusted", "I don't like them either. It makes me sick.": "disgusted", "Yes, I was just flipping through the channels and happened upon a man cutting his own leg off. yuck!": "disgusted", "Oh my gosh! That is disgusting!": "disgusted", "My husband usually gets a substantial bonus this time of the year, but there's no guarantee. It's difficult waiting, and not knowing!": "joy", "What does your husband do for a job?": "joy", "You already told me that. Is he in sales or something similar?": "anger", "He is a welder and iron worker, so he works very hard all year long and does extensive amounts of travel.

I'm glad I eventually did!": "fear", "My wife had a similar experience, she still doesn't drive.  Good for you for overcoming it.": "sadness", "I had to replace my toilet the other day.  It was a new experience, and not altogether pleasant.": "sadness", "That sounds miserable!  Did you do it yourself?": "joy", "Yeah.

Anything to keep the eyes open and on the road!": "joy", "So where did you stop along the way?": "sadness", "I have big renovation plans for my house.

It wasn't meant to be.": "sadness", "I recently heard In The Air Tonight by Phil Collins.": "anticipation", "That's such a good tune.": "joy", "Yeah, for some reason it takes me back to being a kid in the 80's.  No specific memory just a general feeling.": "sadness", "Yeah, it's definitely a classic. It reminds me of my childhood as well.": "sadness", "I got upset at my oldest son's lack of motivation.  I feel bad that I got angry with him though.": "sadness", "Maybe you just have to find a way to get him motivated, without showing anger.": "anger", "True.  I just haven't found a way to yet.  Need to be more creative.": "joy", "Yeah, just stay positive about it, I'm sure you'll figure something out.": "fear", "K and I went to see a house a while ago. I don't know what happened there, but when I went upstairs I became more and more nervous and eventually ran back downstairs and out the door. Scary or what.": "fear", "Was it just a bad feeling you had?": "sadness", "It was as if something was telling me to get out. K had the same feeling in the basement. I've never had that happen before.": "fear", "Maybe someone died there": "sadness", "Could be. It used to be a home for disabled people. We were both terrified, but we didn't say anything until we were back in our car.": "fear", "I love streaming services but sometimes they really frustrate me.": "anger", "Oh yeah, the buffering?  Very annoying.": "anger", "Every once in awhile I get the idea to search for a movie, and almost every time it's either not listed or requires an extra charge.": "sadness", "I hear that.  Sometimes the classics are impossible to find.": "sadness", "My eldest niece, who helps take care of her younger disabled sister, graduated high school with great grades recently. She works hard both at her studies and taking care of her sister - she deserves it.": "surprise", "Did you get her something special?": "surprise", "Yes, I got her tickets for a show in London that she's been wanting to see. She lives in Scotland, so the journey isn't bad at all. She's taking a friend with her.": "joy", "Oh awesome, That is great!": "joy", "I do hope she has a wonderful time.

My husband has been out of town and its been just me and a cranky toddler.": "fear", "Will he be back soon?": "anger", "I sure hope so!

Just then a mom with kids comes around the corner.": "sadness", "ha, that's too funny.": "sadness", "It's been a hard day today, its so quiet in my house. I hate when my husband is out of town.": "sadness", "That sounds tough :-(  does he get back soon?": "anger", "In a few months, he is in the military so he is gone a lot :( But I know he is doing it for our family and our country!": "trust", "You must be so proud of him!": "joy", "My young niece, who is disabled, was recently rushed to hospital. She's ok now but we were very worried for a while there.": "trust", "What was going on with her?": "sadness", "Chest infection which, for her, can prove fatal. She had to go on a special oxygen machine till the antibiotics kicked in.": "sadness", "That sounds pretty serious, glad she is okay now!": "trust", "It was touch and go for a few days. My brother and family are such great carers. Wish I could be too, but they live in Scotland.": "sadness", "I have this cat that loves to cause issues ": "trust", "What sort of issues?": "anger", "Like last night.

The gift was a good idea so that you ca watch it as much as you want'": "sadness", "A few weeks ago a coworker called in sick. I had to work twice as long as I normally would. ": "sadness", "So you covered him. It was very noble from your side to act in this way": "joy", "It was, but it didn't help my feelings towards that coworker. ": "anger", "Well, at least you did something good for that co-worker and most probably he feels indebted toward you": "sadness", "That is true, I just hope he was really sick. I hate it when I have to cover for people who are hungover. ": "sadness", "My wife has been out of the country for school for 2 months.  I misread the calendar and thought she was getting back a week earlier than she is.": "joy", "So you have to wait a week longer to see her again? That stinks.": "anger", "Yeah.  It could be worse, but it definitely put a cloud over things for half an hour or so.": "sadness", "Yeah, I can imagine. At least it's only one week!": "fear", "It's been awhile since I lost my last job.  After two years of working my family and I are finally moving into a home of our own.": "joy", "Great to hear that.I hope you enjoy your new life.": "joy", "After such a long time we certainly will.

I had a dog die unexpectedly and it tore me up.": "sadness", "It really makes me angry to see that many homeless people on the street": "anger", "Yeah I understand.  Are there any charities nearby that you could volunteer for?": "sadness", "I personally dont have time to volunteer but every friday i always make a small donation to my local charity": "trust", "Well that's good of you.

": "fear", "Oh my, did you have a good time?": "joy", "I don't get why anyone would cheat on their other half.": "trust", "I don't understand that either. It really makes you sick to think about. Have you experienced this?": "sadness", "No thankfully  I havent. I would never do it. Have you?": "fear", "No I have not. I would never participate in that either. My wife and I are extremely happy together.": "joy", "I was planning to view the stars last night, but it was storming. It was supposed to be the brightest that Jupiter will be in a while.": "fear", "It always seems to work out like that doesn't it?": "sadness", "It does! I am hoping that tonight will be clear.": "anticipation", "I may have to check that out as well.": "fear", "A new baby means a lot changes.  One of those is the amount of time my wife and I have together.": "sadness", "Yes, but they also bring about a lot of good changes as well.": "sadness", "Agreed.  I know it's a necessary thing but I'm a little jealous of the time my wife spends with the baby.": "anger", "Yes, the first years of a baby's life, the mother pretty much spends entirely with them. The husband is kind of left out in the cold.": "sadness", "My mom is so great! She is always there for me and her grandchildren. I can't think of anyone that loves us as much as she does!": "trust", "That is wonderful! Moms are truly a gift! I miss my Mom at times.

I've always lived close to my mom so I can't really imagine being too far away.": "sadness", "We have always moved frequently with my husbands job but my parents usually end up following us lol.

I actually broke up with a previous girlfriend over the same type of thing.": "sadness", "When I worked as a hotel rep. in Spain a few years ago I was greeting guests one morning. Suddenly I saw someone I knew - it was my cousin who decided to come and visit me. It was so unexpected!": "surprise", "Oh that must have been so exciting and surprising! ": "joy", "It really was. I had no idea he was coming to visit. I couldn't believe my eyes!": "surprise", "Did you all do some fun things while he was there?": "joy", "We certainly did. Where I was working was a seaside resort and there are loads of clubs, restaurants etc. so we'd go to the beach and then party at night. Brilliant fun!": "joy", "My Keurig just died. This is the third coffee pot in less than a year!": "sadness", "Well, that's a real tragedy.": "sadness", "I agree! I am so disgusted right now!!! We drink a lot of coffee lol. Its a 2 hour drive to the closest town to get another one too. ": "disgusted", "Can you buy two next time and have one in reserve?": "anger", "We travel fill-time in our RV so I don't really have room to carry a back up. I hope our next location is more accessible to civilization.": "sadness", "I just had to move across country to a new job. ": "joy", "Wow, that must've been hard to uproot your whole life.

An older boy intentionally tripped her as she got off the bus and she got hurt. This made me very upset and mad!": "anger", "What was the boy kid's problem?": "fear", "He just thought it would be funny! He was also several years older than her and a teenager. Too old to know better!": "sadness", "Maybe he has the crush on her?": "anger", "We recently found out that our 15 year old son has a rare, degenerative neurological disease.": "sadness", "Im so sorry to hear that.

No one should have to go through something like that.": "sadness", "It's hard watching one of your parents get sick. We were at the movie theater when I found out and I had to leave.": "sadness", "I'm sure I would have done the same thing! But stay strong, many people have beaten cancer! Keep a positive attitude and stay by her side!": "trust", "one of the best days of my life was when i graduated from high school": "joy", "that was an awesome day for me too, hard to believe it was nearly  10 years ago": "surprise", "i know right time goes really fast and you dont even noticed, for me it was 13 years ago": "sadness", "agreed! its a shame growing up how fast you wanted to be an adult": "sadness", "The other night I was driving home in the rain and slid into the guard rail. It is going to cost so much to get my car fixed!": "fear", "Oh man, now that sucks! You gotta be careful on those wet roads. At least you're okay.": "sadness", "I know, I will have to be more careful next time.

We just have to make the best with what we are given. You'll get through this.": "sadness", "I was afraid when I went into the movies alone": "fear", "really why is that?": "sadness", "Because I have always been with someone, so going in alone just frightened me": "fear", "I think with time you will get used to it.": "sadness", "I've been married almost 23 years. My husband travel so much, but we both have trust in each other to be true and loyal.": "trust", "That is great, Why does he travel so much?": "joy", "for his job.

Its about time": "sadness", "My sister was given $1,000 by my grandma as a graduation present. She did not give me a penny.": "sadness", "I am sorry, maybe she will share?": "sadness", "Perhaps, I just don't understand why I was left out. Seems unfair.": "anger", "That is infair": "sadness", "We went on our vacation about a week ago to the beach and it rained several days while we were there. We wanted to go to the beach every day!": "joy", "I hate when that happens! Especially when you have been waiting for the beach!": "anger", "Yes, and when you pay a fortune to get beachfront!

Does it have all the bells and whistles?": "anger", "My in-laws are helping us pay for school clothes for our kids this year.": "trust", "That is great! I know my sister has had help with that a lot too! It can get expensive.

I will have to check out Goodwill and see if I can find anything.": "joy", "it's like $5 for new clothes, good quality a lot. Great! Yes it is a lot to buy clothes for ever growing kids": "joy", "Wow, those prices are great. I'll be going by there for sure. Yeah, the best part about them helping, is that they do it, not expecting anything in return. They just all of us and want to help.": "surprise", "THAT is the spirit of a true giver and the only one I would take a gift from! Great in laws!": "anger", "Yes, they are great.": "trust", "I was in a college class once with an older woman.  She took a paper idea I had talked about and presented it as her own, stealing all the work I had done.": "anger", "That is despicable. Did you report her to the teacher?": "anger", "I did.  There wasn't much she could do, but at least I could still do the same paper without having to redo a bunch of work.": "sadness", "She could drop her from the class and give her an F!": "sadness", "i really hate when people make me wait for no reason": "anger", "Me too! Who did this to you?": "joy", "my girlfriend allways makes me wait, it makes me really anxious ahhahah": "fear", "I understand that! When I am ready to go- I just want to hurry up and go. I hate sitting around waiting too. Maybe you should make her wait and see if she likes it. Lesson ": "anticipation", "One of my best friends is moving far away and i dont know when i will be able to see him again": "sadness", "That's so sad! Can you email them?": "sadness", "yeah i can call him and email him, it is just that i dont know when we will see eachother again": "fear", "Can you see him before he goes?": "anger", "I think having goals is important. My mother in law has managed to lose weight and walked daily.": "joy", "Hey, that's pretty good. Do you have any goals set for yourself?": "joy", "Very similar ones, but I like focusing on others success": "sadness", "Well I hope yours work out as well. Focusing on the goals of others probably gives you a lot of inspiration.": "surprise", "It really does, hope any you have works out!": "joy", "i hate to see people mistreating animals i cant stand it": "fear", "Oh I know! I could kill people like that.": "anger", "i know right, it is really sad some people cant understand they suffer as well as you and me": "sadness", "And they don't have a voice of their own.": "sadness", "the day i gratuaded from college is my favorite day": "joy", "Congratulations!

She is depressed and I try and get her out of the house to do things.": "sadness", "We need more people like you in the world.  Theres always someone out there who needs a helping hand and could use a friend.": "trust", "Thanks.  Yes she had some mental issues around the time he died but is doing better now.": "sadness", "We need to come together as a country and be united and solve our issues, no matter your views.": "joy", "I totally agree. People are too divided by their political views these days.": "trust", "Exactly, let's comprimise and decide on things before it's to late!": "anticipation", "Everyone is always fighting over these things, it's a sad thing to see.": "sadness", "I spent my first Christmas away from home in a computer lab, working by myself.": "sadness", "Oh! pity about you.

I hope he got a good raise": "joy", "Hello, I am very upset about the abuse of some people with their pets ... it is unacceptable": "anger", "I can't imagine why people would do that.

I hate seeing animals suffer as well.": "joy", "it's something since I was born ... I'm like that": "joy", "That reminds me of the time I went to LA for vacation with my family. I wanted to meet people so I went hiking in the mountains but it soon became dark. ": "sadness", "Hiking is probably a tough environment to meet people! LA is real nice, but I hear the people there aren't/": "sadness", "Yea it probably wasn't the smartest decision but at the end I meat a nice group. They eventually helped me from that situation also. ": "trust", "That's cool! Did you end up keeping up with them after you left?": "sadness", "I really miss my puppy, we got her a statue for the backyard to remember her always.": "sadness", "Thats sweet to have such a memory of her. Did she pass away then? ": "sadness", "Yes, she was very old. It was a great tribute to her life.": "sadness", "Im so sorry, pets are like children ": "sadness", "my son is teething and he is so cranky! I gave him tylenol and got some teething toys.

It was horrible": "sadness", "i was trying to sleep train my son but i failed. i didn't it's gonna be that hard. I think we will be co sleeping till he goes to college": "sadness", "Ha ha, I'm sure he'll get the the hang of it eventually. It takes some children longer than others to get used to.": "sadness", "I hope so, i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face": "trust", "I'm not looking forward to it when I have a kid! I can't function without a good 8 hours of sleep.": "anger", "I have been seeing pictures of friends of mine traveling around Italy.": "sadness", "How does that make you feel ?": "sadness", "I wish I were with them.

What did you have?": "joy", "I had a nice burger and fries": "surprise", "That sounds good. I bet it was fun to hangout and eat with your friend.": "sadness", "Yes I was appreciative that she wanted to buy me lunch": "trust", "I hate when people pull in front of you, especially when it's clear behidn you.": "anger", "It is very annoying! I hate it too": "anger", "Had to slam my brakes. I don't get people at all.": "fear", "Some people should not be allowed to drive! We were rear ended 2 times last months! Can you believe that": "anger", "yes, sadly I easily can.": "anger", "I know i'm an adult but I'm very scared of the dark. i have a good imagination so i always see something creepy": "fear", "That;s ok, everyone has some kinda fears that make little sense to others.": "fear", "That's why i can't sleep alone or if i'm alone i always keep the light on": "fear", "Hey, I can't sleep without socks.

They get a chance to get out of their cages and be with a nice human like me.": "trust", "That is really nice of you! I am sure they appreciate it": "trust", "They do.

Cats can be very mischievous sometimes. ": "sadness", "I was so mad for the longest time but I've gotten around to not being so made about it": "anger", "Yea I feel you.

Helped me sleep like a baby,.": "joy", "It was the single most calming thing! I love the sound of rain on a tin roof too! ": "joy", "I wonder if that's a common thing? It's very relaxing.": "joy", "i got in a car accident 2 months ago and now i get so anxious every time i need to drive somewhere": "fear", "I'm sorry for that. Have you tried going to therapy?": "sadness", "not yet. i'm so broke i can't even afford it. I had to buy a new car and my premiums went up ": "anger", "I'm so sorry but you'll get there in time.": "sadness", "Though the odds are against you, I understand why people gamble. I remember a particular time I was playing video poker at a local dive bar.": "sadness", "I've never gambled. What happened when you were playing video poker? And is it fun?": "sadness", "Well, take this with a grain of salt, but it CAN be a blast. I put in $5 like I usually do, and on the first deal, I hit $1000. I went nuts, cashing out immediately and started shoving $20 bills in to everyone's hands and pockets!": "sadness", "Wow, check out Mr. Moneybags over here! That must have been a real thrill though.": "sadness", "I honestly think New Orleans is one of the most exciting places to live in the US. You never know what you are going to find around the corner.": "joy", "Yes, it does seem like a fun place. I would love to go to the Mardi Gras.": "trust", "Mardi Gras is great, but stuff happens every day. One time I was showing some friends around from out of town, and we heard some voices on the other side of a fence. We ducked through a hole, and found a bar with a full band playing - complete with couples swing dancing!": "sadness", "That sounds like a lot of fun! I wish I would have seen it!": "joy", "I hate when you go out on a limb for someone and they turn around and burn you for it. You know what I mean?": "fear", "I'd say that'd be a real disappointment to say the least.": "sadness", "You can say that again. One time, I loaned a friend a bike to get to work and back. A couple weeks later I heard he stopped going to work and had pawned the bike for drug money.": "surprise", "End of friendship.": "sadness", "I am not quite sure what you mean by that?": "sadness", "sorry that was sent by an mistake": "sadness", "That's OK, It happens to the best of us!": "sadness", "I don't think I am a judgmental person, but we all have our limits. I stayed on my girlfriend's friend's homestead for a day, and I can still smell it.": "fear", "oh that little unfair": "anger", "Trust me, this place was out of control. They had the pig pen and the chicken coup within a stones throw of the main house. To top it off, they had running clean water, but no toilet indoors! ": "disgusted", "oh enjoy dude": "joy", "I just finished working on a presentation that I'm supposed to give tomorrow.": "fear", "Congrats! How do you feel about it? And what is the presentation on?": "joy", "I feel pretty good about it.  I've spent the last two weeks crunching numbers about our holiday projections.": "joy", "It's good that you worked hard on it. I hope you get a raise or a bonus for your labor!": "joy", "I'll find out at Christmas.  Considering all the numbers I looked at, the possibility looks good! ": "anticipation", "Sometimes you know your friends better than even their long term roommates know them. Have you ever been in that situation?": "sadness", "I think so.  Sometimes our friends show us sides of them that they rarely show other people.": "anger", "That's definitely true! I am thinking of one person in particular to be honest. We waited all night at her house for her to join us so we could make this party. She never showed!": "trust", "Did you make the party anyway?": "sadness", "Not too long ago, my mother unexpectedly paid off a high monthly payment and interest loan! I couldn't believe it! ": "surprise", "Wow. That is a blessing": "trust", "Yes, I didn't have a clue she was going to do it and it was very much appreciated it.She's always so great thought, I am blessed.": "trust", "I am going to always take care of my kids like that": "trust", "I broke a finger the other day and couldn't do any dishes! It was terrible ": "sadness", "I hate doing dishes any way": "anger", "I was super lucky though because my husband just went up and did them all for me! ": "trust", "That's sweet": "trust", "So I managed to get all my school shopping done this week so the kids have all their things ready to go for tomorrow!": "joy", "Cool I just finished today": "joy", "I got an early start this year.  Most years I start late and they're out of stuff I need by the time I get around to it.": "sadness", "Yeah we had a hard time today lol": "sadness", "And then the stores get so crowded after a certain point!  ": "joy", "I am going to do like you next year for sure!": "joy", "I think next year I'm going to start early but just do everything online.  All the stores in town were absolute messes today!": "anger", "I was having a bad day the other day and everything just kept going wrong ": "sadness", "That happens sometimes": "sadness", "The worst part of the day though was when I dropped my last cookie I was really looking forward to": "sadness", "I probably wouldve cried": "sadness", "I fought off hordes of people shopping for school stuff all at the same time and I won!  I got everything on their lists!": "joy", "Was it like black friday? lol": "disgusted", "YES.  *chuckle!*  School starts tomorrow here and it was absolutely insane.  The worst part was, usually I go to the store regularly before 10A because there's less people in there and I can just kinda stroll through the aisles.  Oh no, not today.  It was just about elbow to elbow!": "anger", "Stick to your routine next time": "joy", "I have to grocery shop on Thursday and hopefully the furor will have died down.  But I was in the checkout line and I swore that next year, I'm ordering stuff online and having it all shipped and just keeping my happy self at home!  ": "sadness", "I hear ya! I am definitely shopping online": "joy", "Especially since I was just browsing and a lot of online places have deals better than the ones in store!": "sadness", "plus you can usually get some kind of cash back. I love deals": "sadness", "The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider ": "fear", "Ew, I hate spiders. We are in the process of getting them out of our garage.": "fear", "I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that! ": "sadness", "Oh no, throw it away!!!!": "anger", "It's not that I am adverse to avant garde theater, but this \"play\" I went to recently was a little too much.": "fear", "How was it too much?": "joy", "Well, to their credit, they had advertised it as being quite interactive. A little contact is OK, but they wanted me to eat \"mystery candy\" from a box while blindfolded!": "surprise", "That sounds very strange": "sadness", "Around this time of the year, my husband usually always gets a large bonus, but it's not a promise. It's not easy waiting to see if he will!": "anticipation", "How big is the bonus usually?": "joy", "It all depends, but always has been thousands. So, the waiting drives us nuts!": "fear", "Wow, well I hope you guys get it this year then!": "joy", "When my friend told me to give him my last $400, I thought he was crazy. But in the end, I am glad I did.": "trust", "Why did you do that?": "sadness", "He has these crackpot schemes but they always work out. We turned that $400 in to $2000 a piece selling posters at a music festival!": "surprise", "Wow, good for you guys!": "trust", "Not all of my high-school memories are fond ones. Like the time I drank too much and passed out at a party.": "sadness", "How old were you?": "sadness", "I was about 16 at the time. The thing is, I passed out right in front of the entrance to the house. Everyone coming and going had to step over me!": "sadness", "That is young, I wish someone had helped you!": "trust", "I don't know how you are with Calc, but I can get pretty anxious before an exam.": "fear", "Math has never been my strong suit. I'm more of a history type of person.": "joy", "Me neither! That's why I was amazed when this girl said she had made a study guide and would e-mail us all a copy. I ended up with a B!": "surprise", "That was very altruistic of her! ": "trust", "My cat kept doing her best to wake me up last night ": "anger", "Why she is doing that?": "anger", "She was trying to wake me up to get me to play with her! ": "sadness", "Ah ok I undestand.": "sadness", "I never thought I would be where I am today. If you would have told me I would go back to school at 27, I would have thought you were crazy.": "sadness", "why did you go back?": "sadness", "I had always wanted to be an electrical engineer, but had settled for life in the service industry (not knocking it).

I feel like he chooses her over me a lot. I hate feeling like I have to compete with her. ": "anger", "I understand! I would feel the same way.": "sadness", "i cant believe the growth video games are having this past couple of years": "anticipation", "What do you mean by that? I'm not a gamer really": "anger", "gaming has blown up this past couple of years ": "surprise", "Oh you're right, it has. I hear about it more and more": "sadness", "I love roller coasters, but I hate that my favorite amusement parks close during the winter. ": "fear", "I hate that most parks close during the winter too. Do you have any indoor type amusement parks near you?": "fear", "Not that I'm aware of. :( When February rolls around, all I can think about is how much I miss them and how I can't wait to go back.": "sadness", "I feel you. You will just have to go as often as possible during the other months to make up for the winter time without!": "joy", "I'm excited to graduate college and start my career soon! I have a feeling that my life will get much better once I do.": "joy", "Ooh, congratulations! I'll be graduating soon too. What's your major?": "joy", "I'm an Engineering major, electrical engineering specifically. And yourself?": "joy", "That's very cool. My dad's an electrical engineer, actually. I'm a cybersecurity major myself.": "joy", "i really am thankful for everything that i have and had": "trust", "What is your most prized posession?": "joy", "it is actually a little medal my dad gave me when i was little": "surprise", "Why is that?": "sadness", "he gave it to me beafore he went to the army, and when he came back i showed it to him and it was really emotional": "fear", "My little brother has gotten really good at bowling recently and it kind of floors me!": "surprise", "Oh wow, maybe he can get a scholarship! I know some colleges now offer bowling athletic programs.": "joy", "Perhaps! He's joining the high school bowling team so that may help his chances as well. Do you like to bowl yourself?": "sadness", "You must be very proud of him! Yes, I love to bowl with my family but I'm not very good at it!": "joy", "I keep hearing strange noises in my house. My husband is out of town and I'm all alone. There has been reports of break ins on my street.": "fear", "That is scary. Do you have means of defending yourself?\\": "fear", "No I don't, I do have two dogs! They keep growling at the noises to!": "fear", "Maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! Don't hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!": "fear", "So I suck hard at bowling, but tonight I tried to be pro and putting spin on the ball. I ended up just throwing it down the lane instead.": "sadness", "Ha ha! I have done that, too. So embarrassing.": "sadness", "Yeah, my face was bright red when the ball almost went into the other lane! Thankfully there was somebody that sucked even worse than me in my party.": "anger", "Phew, so they got most of the attention.": "anger", "I have a very good friend and her boyfriend made sexual advances towards me. I never did tell my friend, for various reasons, but I feel really guilty and bad about it@!": "sadness", "It can be hard in those situation I know you don't want to loose a friend in the end.": "sadness", "Yes, and there were financial and personal reasons of her own that is why I didn't tell her. Plus, I really hated to hurt her, but I guess I should have told her.": "sadness", "Yes you should but when you feel comfortable don't feel guilty you are the victim he is a sad case you got this.": "sadness", "I still live and work in the place where I grew up, but all of my friends have moved away.": "sadness", "Aw, that has to be tough not to see your friends. Do they visit often?": "sadness", "No, everyone's so busy with their lives and work that it's hard to arrange. Most of the people here my age do drugs or stay out all night, so I keep to myself at home, alone.": "sadness", "How awful! You're much better off staying at home. I hope you find new friends soon!": "sadness", "So college is starting up soon and I'm worried I won't be able to deal with the workload again.": "fear", "School can be tough. How many credits are you taking on?": "joy", "I wanna say 14 credit hours for engineering classes. I have a part time job too I work 20 hours a week at.": "joy", "Engineering is already tough. If you can get through this, I'd say you'll be very successful in life.": "fear", "So college is starting up soon and I feel more ready than ever to do well this year!": "joy", "oh you're gonna be awesome i bet!": "joy", "Thanks, I'm going to try! Last semester wasn't bad but I procrastinated more than I should have.": "sadness", "yeah that always happens, don't be hard on yourself as long you do great": "sadness", "So I just had an amazing dinner and am now relaxing in my room. I feel very at ease.": "joy", "Nice. What was dinner?": "joy", "Surprisingly enough, a pizza from the bowling alley. I never said that I was picky!": "surprise", "I haven't met a pizza I didn't like yet.": "sadness", "my son is teething really bad and he is so inconsolable that breaks my heart. i can't wait till these molars cut thru": "fear", "I remember my kids going through that.

I hope he gets through it soon.": "anger", "I think I will be very busy Monday night playing my new game.": "joy", "What is the game about you must love games it will take up your whole night.": "joy", "World of warcraft. I'v got a deeper reason then it being a game- it's how i meet my husband.": "sadness", "Really that is a cool story to tell when asked how you 2 met did ya'll play online together a lot?": "sadness", "I come home from work and my parents always seem to be arguing. It's very frustrating.": "anger", "Oh that's not good. Do they argue about small things?": "sadness", "Yes they do. They act like children and I am essentially the most mature/responsible one in the house.": "trust", "Yikes, that shouldn't be. I think you've really stepped up in this situation. Hopefully they can see that and change their ways.": "sadness", "I think storms are wonderful, except when the power goes out.": "joy", "I love storms too but yeah, that's a nuisance.": "joy", "It was extra loud and my husband was at work, bit scary.": "fear", "Yikes! Lightning didn't strike real close by, did it?": "fear", "O it sure seemed like it did, dogs were scared too.": "fear", "College is starting soon and I'm feeling like I'll be able to stay on top of homework this semester!": "joy", "That is good. Will it be a difficult semester?": "joy", "It probably will be, as I'm studying engineering. I feel confident that I won't procrastinate as much this time though!": "joy", "That is good. I am sometime a procrastinator.": "joy", "I recently heard a music artist for the first time in a long time that brought me back to my childhood.": "sadness", "Awww, what fun.  That must have been so nostalgic for you!  I wish I was back in childhood again sometimes.": "sadness", "It sure was! I enjoy reliving the memories, things were often simpler and more carefree back then.": "sadness", "I saw a toy that they are bringing back from a couple decades ago when I was a kid and wow, it was so neat to see!": "surprise", "So I consider myself a decent bowler but my brother came out of nowhere, he's actually really skilled. I'm kind of shocked actually.": "surprise", "Wow. Sibling's got skills.": "joy", "For sure. I am here doing the traditional bowling style and he is spinning the ball across the lane getting strikes often. He makes me look bad!": "sadness", "How long has he been bowling?": "joy", "I am so nervous to start my new job tommorrow.": "fear", "I am sorry to hear that, I am sure you will be fine. What kind of job is it?": "fear", "it's a desk job. Its my first time in a place like this.": "joy", "Well, it shouldn't be too bad. If you couldn't do the work I'm sure they wouldn't have hired you.": "sadness", "So I had a customer sign the wrong form today. I feel kind of bad because I'll have to have them sign the right thing next time and I'll look incompetent.": "sadness", "That's a bummer. At least you will be more attentive next time?": "sadness", "For sure, that is a silver lining. Mistakes happen I suppose, can't expect to be perfect!": "anger", "Indeed. If everyone got worked up over things like that, we'd all be out of jobs.": "joy", "So I went on a road trip to Utah a few months ago after my friends backed out. It was awesome but I did miss them.": "sadness", "That sounds incredible. Did you visit the Great Salt Lake?": "surprise", "No I didn't get around to that area! I did visit Arches and Canyonlands national parks though. Even though I was by myself, would do again!": "disgusted", "Man, I definitely have to go there. Sounds like a great place for sightseeing.": "joy", "So my brother got my dream vehicle as his first car. I am feeling a certain way about this!": "joy", "Oh my god, Do you think he got it just because you like it so much?": "anger", "I don't think so actually, I haven't let him know that I love that type in particular so much haha. I am definitely wishing it was mine though!": "anticipation", "That is hilarious, In a cruel kind of way.": "sadness", "So I want to buy a new vehicle but I'm nervous about pulling the trigger on it.": "fear", "Ohh, I feel you. I felt the same way, when I was planning to buy a new car.": "sadness", "Yep. Like, my current car is dying, but I almost literally want to drive it until it no longer runs at all.": "anticipation", "Yeah. I believe you are emotionally attached to it!": "sadness", "PEople are crazy now a days. I watched people try to take a gas can from my yard!": "joy", "Wow why would they even do that?": "anger", "It was during a power outage during a hurricane,  still made me mad.": "anger", "Sheesh, people will take anything that's not nailed down these days.": "anger", "So my car wouldn't start today after work. I kind of hate my car!": "anger", "That's terrible to hear. Is it old?": "sadness", "Oh yes, very old. It's a 2002 and while I've had it for 6 years now, I'm finally starting to grow tired of it.": "sadness", "Are you thinking of getting a new car?": "anger", "I hate giving big presentations and being the center of attention.": "fear", "Me too. Its nerve wrecking": "fear", "I know! Like, mentally, I don't care, but my body just responds by making my legs shake, my heart pound, and speaking too quickly.": "fear", "Maybe you should take some classes to help you with that": "sadness", "I had to dogsit for my dad about a week ago. I had to clean up dog poop at least 10 times, it was awful.": "disgusted", "Ohh, cleaning dog poop is always been annoying, yet petting the dog is always amusing.": "disgusted", "Oh yes. I wish I could say petting the dogs counteracted having to clean up after them, but I would be lying.": "disgusted", "Ha ha. I feel sorry for you though. No one likes to clean the dog poop!": "disgusted", "So I was listening to rap in my car with the windows down. The people in the car next to me were just staring at me. It was kinda awkward.": "sadness", "That has happened to me several times": "sadness", "Yeah, not gonna lie my face turned a bit red and I rolled the windows up slightly. Thankfully they are very tinted so they probably didn't notice my shame.": "sadness", "Lol. They probably just laughed about it over dinner": "sadness", "I was really worried about how I'd afford textbooks this semester. ": "fear", "Were you able to get them?": "sadness", "Yes, everything's taken care of, thanks to my boyfriend-- he surprised me with all of the books I needed!": "trust", "That was so sweet of him!

Rollercoasters are thrilling and should not be missed out on!": "fear", "When I turned 40 last year, my kids planned a birthday party for me that I had no idea about.": "sadness", "oh wow! that sounds very special!!!": "joy", "It really was and just what I need as I wasn't really happy about turning that corner into my 40's.": "joy", "im glad your family did that for you": "trust", "A few weeks ago we were at a wedding. Everyone was dancing and having fun and all of a sudden my 3 year old niece started to choke on a carrot. So scary!": "fear", "Oh wow! That must have been terrifying! Were they able to help her?": "fear", "Yes, someone was able to do the Heimlich maneuver and she was ok right after that. It was quite the panic for a few minutes though.": "fear", "I could imagine. It must have been amazing to see her rescued though!": "surprise", "So an online payment distributor company won't instantly verify my bank account even though the login info is correct. Feels bad man.": "sadness", "That sucks. Did they give you any reason why they won't verify it?": "anger", "Nope. I even double checked the login info and signed into my bank's website no problem. I feel a bit let down.": "sadness", "Well, I hope they can get you taken care of soon. I know I hate it when I can't get to my money I have online.": "sadness", "Today is my off day and I wanted to sleep in, yet here I am awake early.": "fear", "I am the same.. woke up at 6 for no reason": "anger", "It sucks. I guess my body doesn't want me to sleep in any more.": "sadness", "LOL i hate that": "anger", "I was dog sitting at my dad's house last week and I heard strange noises in his house.": "fear", "I don't know, it was very odd. I would go in the kitchen and the sink would be running a little bit even though I didn't turn it on. Kind of spooky.": "fear", "I understand those kind of situation could scarry.": "fear", "Last semester, I had to give a class presentation. My stomach was full of butterflies from the nerves.": "fear", "how did it go?": "sadness", "All things considered, pretty well. I definitely had some anxiety about it though.

You have to give into your sweet tooth.": "sadness", "Sometimes you just have to! It felt so great then but I hated it the next morning! ": "joy", "Ugh, I hate the regret that comes with giving into food cravings. Don't be too hard on yourself. It was just one time.": "sadness", "My husbands cancer free now!

": "joy", "good then you will do well!": "joy", "My parents always argue and it pisses me off!": "sadness", "i bet, have you told them how u feel about it?": "sadness", "I have but they rarely listen. They act like children and it can get frustrating. What can you do?": "anger", "i guess just walk away is all": "sadness", "Sometimes life just gives you lemons. At an old job of mine, I had what will probably remain the worst performance review of my life.": "sadness", "Well you can get better": "sadness", "I'm not sure it was really about my performance at all. I was surprised by the presence of my only adversary there, and informed that a large part of my position would be dissolved, and I would be answering phones.": "surprise", "You will do better next time, I promise": "sadness", "That's must be a relief for you.  I am assuming you have children?": "trust", "I do not have those": "sadness", "So I guess that sending anyone off to school is not a big deal to you?  Do you attend school?": "sadness", "I do not attend school": "sadness", "Do you have something you are looking forward to?": "anticipation", "My father passed away about 2 1/2 years ago. It was totally unexpected and really was very traumatic and hurtful to me. He was still quite young and my family and I had no idea he had a life threatening health issue.": "sadness", "I am sorry to hear that, I hope you had some time together before hand": "sadness", "I was pretty close to my father and always lived close by. But, you always wish you had more time. But, the last words I said to him was that I loved him, and I'm grateful for that.": "trust", "That is good at least, you had some closure at the worst": "sadness", "Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen": "sadness", "we were walking in the front door and it had a glass door apparently but I didn't see it.  It was a very clean door.  LOL.  Later on that night I won a door prize.  which was pretty funny]": "surprise", "What did you win?": "joy", "My daughter caught me in a bad mood the other day and was being a bit argumentative. I lost my temper, yelled and really hurt her feelings. I felt bad that it happened.": "sadness", "Oh that sucks.  Those are the types of situations where you can't help it, but you know you did wrong the second after it's over.": "fear", "Yes, I was already not in a good mood, and then it seemed like she just pushed the right button. But, I knew I shouldn't have done it as soon as I saw the look in her eyes, I felt very bad.": "sadness", "Well, there aren't any rules against apologizing to your kids?": "sadness", "You never know what someone else is going through, and looks can be deceiving. Like this old man that seemed like any other drunk.": "anger", "Yeah you can judge someone like that": "sadness", "It was hard to tell honestly, but it turned out the guy was lost and diabetic. He had lost track of his friends and had no way to get home, so I hailed him a cab and paid the driver $20.": "sadness", "Thats a nice gesture from you": "trust", "We hadn't been to the beach and years and really wanting to go back for vacation. We were able to a few weeks ago and it was awesome. I was thrilled!": "joy", "Oh man, the beach always sounds nice": "joy", "It's was great. The weather was perfect most of the time, and we were able to relax and enjoy it so much. We were really hyped to go!": "joy", "That sounds like it was lovely": "sadness", "The last time I went to the fair, I tripped over a big cord. This led to me having one of those running falls, that seem to last forever! I wanted to disappear at that moment!": "sadness", "I am sure not many people noticed": "sadness", "Oh no, there were tons of people that noticed lol. I can laugh now, but not at that moment.": "sadness", "I can imagine, sorry": "sadness", "I lost a puppy recently and I'm still broken up about it.": "sadness", "I am so sorry I have been there so many times": "sadness", "it's never going to be ok, but it will be a little less painful in time.": "sadness", "I am sorry you had to go through that": "sadness", "I'm sorry youve been there too.,": "sadness", "It's not fun when a 4 year old does something he shouldnt.": "sadness", "What did they do": "anger", "Took a small toy, put it in his pocket. took it back to the store and made him return it.": "sadness", "Oh well, he will learn": "sadness", "Yea, he seems to get it now.": "sadness", "As a mom I sometimes sneak a sweet treat when I make it out alone.": "sadness", "You do what you want, you earn it!": "joy", "Still feel bad when I got an ice cream the other day": "sadness", "Why?": "sadness", "I've had a rough week! The house has been a mess from my dogs and toddler. My husband hasn't been helping out much, its fustrating!": "anger", "Why is he not helping?": "trust", "I'm not sure! He has been busy with work but also has been going out with friends a lot :(": "sadness", "Oh, well work can be tough too sometimes": "sadness", "My niece made me proud today, graduated from her nursing school.": "joy", "I bet you are proud": "joy", "YEa, she's over come a lot for it.": "sadness", "I am sure she did": "sadness", "Since it was my birthday today, when I came home there was a big pink cake and flowers waiting for me :)": "surprise", "that is sweet, who from?": "sadness", "My husband!

We had to open the windows to be able to sleep! ": "fear", "Oh wow, talk about bad timing": "sadness", "The icing on the sweaty cake was that a giant horse fly kept buzzing around the room and the moment you got comfy would land on you": "sadness", "Oh no, I hate flies": "anger", "I'm so excited!

I'm glad you have fond memories of him.": "sadness", "my friend can literally eat junk food all day long and stay skinny! She doesn't even work out. and here i am, eating healthy, working out and still loking fat": "anger", "She may be skinny, but it doesn't mean she's healthy.": "sadness", "that's true too! But i just wish i looked like her": "sadness", "Yea, I totally understand that. She won the genetic lottery there.": "sadness", "It was my birthday and My friend sent me a birthday card with a gift card in a mail... i never got it, somebody stole it! and we actually have a cluster mailbox so only i can open it. it means that usps worker stole it": "surprise", "Have you tried speaking with the post office?": "anger", "i did, the lady told me they can't do anything about it because it didn't have a tracking number.

It was a dead mouse": "sadness", "Eww... that's pretty gross. I had a cat once that would bring me dead birds too.

Did you guys use the bathroom anyway?": "disgusted", "It sounds crazy to say, but even though I was hit by a car on my bicycle, it could have been much worse.": "anger", "Are you okay?": "sadness", "I'm quite fine now (my knee has a plate and six screws). I am just glad that the driver stopped and called an ambulance!": "fear", "oh my gosh, a plate! That kinda sounds serious.": "anger", "It might be, but considering I'm 29 with an artificial hip as well, I've gotten used to being half metal.": "joy", "Last semester was probably the largest challenge of my life. I go to school for electrical engineering, and I took 6 courses.": "joy", "that is a lot.. most i ever took at one time was 5 classes and i cried at least twice that semester.": "sadness", "Oh my gosh then you know! I have to say though, it all came out in the wash - 4 As and 2 Bs!": "joy", "Damn that is impressive congrats.. I took 1 class last semester and got an A lol": "joy", "Waiting for something to come in the mail can send me in to a tizzy. It's even worse when it's parts I need to finish a computer repair job.": "anticipation", "That's true. Did you finish the job?": "fear", "I did get it done in the end. It was a nail biter since the client was leaving the day after the parts came.": "fear", "That's really great. It's nice when everything works out in the end.": "joy", "Have you ever lost control of your bowels as an adult?": "sadness", "Oh, all the time.

I just would've blamed it on whoever I was with.": "sadness", "I went to a heavy metal music festival in Las Vegas a few years ago! I had fun, but to be honest it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster.": "sadness", "Oh, I don't know why concerts make me feel a bit sentimental": "sadness", "I think it's because everybody can relate when it comes to live music. My girlfriend broke up with me the second day, but we had to stay in the same room.": "sadness", "That must have been horrible! I'm so sorry you went thru that": "sadness", "You know how sometimes things don't go as planned, but it feels like they turn out better in the end?": "sadness", "Yes, some people call it fate.": "sadness", "You could call it that! I was supposed to go to a social event, but it got rained out and I ended up watching the rain for hours with my girlfriend.": "sadness", "That sounds so romantic!": "joy", "My father was having abdominal pain, so he went to the hospital and they discovered a tumor.": "sadness", "Oh no, was it benign?": "fear", "It was cancerous, but the surgery to remove it seemed to go well. A few days later he passed away suddenly, with no exact cause of death.": "sadness", "That is so terrible, I'm so sorry.": "sadness", "I love it when the new star wars movies come out, seeing all those kids (and adults) dress up for the theater really takes me back! ": "anticipation", "Do you dress up when the new movies come out also?": "sadness", "I don't anymore, but when I was a kid, a friend and I dressed up as the hero and the villain for the premiere of Episode I. ": "sadness", "Ah, I bet seeing all of the kids now dressed up does take you back to an earlier time.  Nostalgia has a way of getting to each of us.": "sadness", "On our second date, my girlfriend and I stopped in a dive bar on our way back from the beach.": "joy", "what is a dive bar": "fear", "Like a hole in the wall. Cheap drinks, sometimes a little dirty, but altogether relaxed - the opposite of snoody. They had a pool table and I showed her some tricks.": "joy", "oh ok. We call them hole in the walls lol": "sadness", "Yeah, I should have just said that. Honestly though, my favorite places to drink.": "disgusted", "mine too.": "sadness", "My father passed away a few years ago, but I still have my grandfather's watch that he gave to me.": "sadness", "are you going to pass it down too?": "joy", "I honestly hope to. Every time I look at it I remember the good times we had together.": "sadness", "well thats nice": "joy", "Hanging out with old flames can be tricky when you are in a committed exclusive relationship.": "trust", "Oh yeah that can be a mine field to walk across. Didn't have any issues?": "sadness", "Actually, an ex was in town recently and we went for a drink. She made a pass at me, but I told her to get some rest and went home to my girlfriend.": "sadness", "That's very faithful of you, and the right thing to do I'd say. ": "trust", "going near hights really makes me scared": "fear", "Did a specific experience cause this? or just instinct.": "sadness", "just instinc i think i have always been afraid of heights ": "fear", "Thats interesting my mother has always been afraid of heights, Not myself though.": "fear", "During carnival season, there is a big rave at an undisclosed location in the middle of the night.": "fear", "I use to go to raves when I was in high school.": "joy", "They are a lot of fun! I must admit though, I was pretty nervous when the cops showed up to shut it down.": "fear", "Did you get arrested?": "sadness", "Well, there were only two officers and a couple hundred of us.

I started studying hard two weeks before the test.": "joy", "tHat is insane, I usually give myself like 2 or 3 days.": "surprise", "Trust me it all paid off. When I went in to take the test, I was absolutely solid on the material.": "trust", "Thats right! thats such a good feeling, just breezing through a test.": "joy", "Felt sad when she left for 3 weeks": "sadness", "Where did she go?": "sadness", "To see her family. It sucked though because my car had broken down.": "sadness", "Oh, I bet that was frustrating.

Sounds like you hit it out of the park!": "sadness", "Some people are just naturals. The first time I played pool with a friend of mine, she had to beat the guy running the table.": "anger", "Pool's always a difficult game to pick up. I'm guessing your first time went well?": "joy", "I shot so-so, but my friend ended up winning the table and beating 5 guys in a row.": "anger", "Wow. Talking about cleaning up.": "disgusted", "I didn't receive a scholarship in college that I really wanted despite being qualified for it.": "joy", "Are you still going to attend it?": "sadness", "Yes, I'll still attend but the extra help would've been nice.": "trust", "Of course, but at least you can still afford it.": "anger", "I know things will work out in God's perfect timing": "joy", "Yes, I agree, are you hoping for something in particular.": "anticipation", "Yes I am. For everything we want for the baby to be gifted to us lol": "joy", "That's a good hope. Good luck with that.

But you should trust some people whom you think they're good.": "trust", "You just can't trust people any more. My mechanic told me it was going to be $1000 to fix my Jeep.": "anger", "Wow that sounds pretty high to me. What was wrong with it?": "disgusted", "Turns out, nothing much at all. A guy down the street got it running for $100.": "surprise", "Wow what a crook that other guy was!": "anger", "I am so happy that we're having a baby boy": "joy", "Congratulations!

No more stompy screechy neighbors at 3 am!!": "joy", "School for my kids started again this past Thursday.": "sadness", "How was that? Were you excited for some more quiet and for them to get back on a schedule? Or are you sad that it shows that they're getting older?": "sadness", "It was good.

I was happy I had all the supplies, clothes, shoes, and other odds and ends in time.": "joy", "Ah, that's interesting you say that.

LOL": "joy", "I was so excited watching the numbers being drawn, but no I didn't win. But someone did! I'm sure they were happy.": "surprise", "Winning those huge jackpots is always a curse.  Go for a smaller win :)": "sadness", "True, but it would be fun spending that money.": "sadness", "My husband just found out he will start getting a monthly bonus! This was unexpected and great news": "surprise", "That is so exciting. A little extra cash can always help.": "trust", "It sure does. It came as a shock, but a pleasant one.

It can also take a lot of stress off of you.": "surprise", "I just went today to visit my son in his new house.": "joy", "how was it": "sadness", "It was great! He has saved for so long to buy it.

I asked my doctor for a chance to try a new diet I found that is suppose to help me with it.": "sadness", "Oh dear, that must be difficult. Are there medications to take that will help?": "sadness", "yes, but they are quite powerful which I am trying to avoid.  I am already on one and I am hoping that through this diet I can get off b/c the next steps won't be fun": "sadness", "Oh, I'm really sorry. That is for sure a challenge. ": "sadness", "Some time ago, there was a terrible tornado that came through my city. It destroyed many homes, a school and some people died. I was so fearful and petrified it would come by our home and destroy it, or harm my familY!": "sadness", "I'm glad you were safe.

Make sure she knows you are thankful!": "trust", "A few weeks ago, we finally got a chance to get back to the beach for our vacation. But, it rained several days, so we didn't get to spend as much time at the beach as we wanted, which sucked. We were really looking forward to it.": "anticipation", "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you not live close to a beach?": "sadness", "Oh, no, it was about a 7 hour drive! My daughter was quite young when we went and didn't remember the first trip and she's a teenager now.

He's a good young man, so we didn't feel uncomfortable anything would come up missing.": "trust", "Lucky! I would not trust anyone in my house!": "trust", "We didn't have much choice, as we had an outdoor dog and indoor cat, so if we didn't, we'd come back to not having pets. But, I wouldn't just let anybody, that's for sure!": "sadness", "I am happy for you! ": "joy", "My mother-in-law once told a secret of mine that she promised she would never tell": "trust", "Oh no! That's my greatest fear that people will tell my secrets": "fear", "I know it really hurt me and I had to work on trusting her again with other things": "trust", "Aw, perhaps she just slipped up? It does happen even to the best of us": "sadness", "One night when my children and I came home, I saw a shadow inside! I was so fearful and afraid!": "fear", "Oh that can be scary.

How is everyone holding up after the news?": "sadness", "It was one of the hardest things I had to go through but I know that Riley is not suffering anymore so that helps": "sadness", "Yes that is true. You know there is peace in another place. He will always be remembered.": "sadness", "I didn't tell my friend when her boyfriend hit on me.

Do you think there might be another way to let her know? ": "sadness", "Well, she had custody of her handicapped grandchild and no job, plus she was very much in love with him.

": "sadness", "Really!  Good for you!  Are you excited to start or nervous?": "joy", "I am nervous b/c so much rides on if this works or not.  If it doesn't than I have to take some really powerful meds that i would rather not take": "fear", "It's OK to be nervous, but don't let it stop you!  No risk, no reward!": "fear", "There's a coworker that will not follow instructions on work assignments, so she makes many mistakes. It's so frustrating and aggravating, since it causes others more work.": "anger", "That sucks, I work with people like that and it's just more work for other people": "anger", "Exactly! You try nicely to explain it to her over and over, but she won't listen. Such a nuisance!": "anger", "That's horrible, you should tell the boss and get her fired": "anger", "My mother picked my daughter up for school to take in the morning, and found her cat dead. It was so hard for my daughter and made us all very upset.": "sadness", "I bet it was.  Death is never an easy thing to deal with, especially for a child.": "sadness", "Yes, she was only about 9, and loved her cat so much. It broke my heart to see her so upset!": "sadness", "I hope she will be alright!  I remember how devastated I was when my last dog passed away and I was an adult.  A kids emotions seem to amplify everything! ": "sadness", "I decided to play the lottery the other day and won.": "surprise", "You are lucky!": "joy", "Not normally, so I was quite surprised.

Congratulations": "surprise", "Thank you, that was the first time I have ever won anything like that. I almost passed out. ": "joy", "I have a bad experience at the supermarket the other day. ": "anger", "Oh no! What happened?": "sadness", "Someone backed into my new car.": "anger", "Oh geez, thats terrible!  Did they run from the scene?  Hopefully they left some information.  I was in a hit and run about 4 months after I bought my new car and I felt sick that it was already hit.": "anger", "Yes, they ran! I was so mad when I got to the car and saw it. ": "anger", "Many years ago, we were at a friend's house and one of her friend's was there and she was drunk. My husband was very insistent on helping her, but I felt he was being a bit to 'helpful'. It made me a bit angry!": "anger", "Wow. Do think he had bad intentions?": "sadness", "Well, she was attractive and at the time, I thought he was thinking that too. But, I know now he was just trying to help her get to a safe place, since she was falling down. But, it was hard to see it at that time lol": "sadness", "I had a bad morning when I went to check my mail.": "sadness", "Oh man...I hate checking the mail..it could be something crappy": "anger", "Especially when you find your mailbox laying in about 10 pieces after someone knocked it down last night. ": "anger", "Oh god- Do you live in the country?": "fear", "Not really. I live in town, but it's a small town.": "sadness", "Then the person might be caught, do you have a camera? That is really crappy of someone! I have seen people put metal or wood pallets next to their mailboxes because of people doing stuff like this": "anger", "That's a good idea. I might do that. We don't have a camera because we don't normally have any troubles.": "anger", "It's a good idea to have one just in case. Murders, robberies etc happen even in small/nice towns. Just for your safety ": "sadness", "My aunt came to visit today, we went out for mexican food!": "surprise", "That sounds nice.  Did you have a good time?": "joy", "Yes, kind of upset she was only able to stay in town for a few hours, she is on a road trip!": "sadness", "That is a shame.  At least she made a stopover!": "sadness", "I have a big exam for college coming up, I have been studying day and night.": "joy", "What's the exam on?": "joy", "It is for my molecular biology class, I feel pretty good that I am going to Ace it. ": "joy", "I wish you good luck!": "joy", "I went and saw a hockey game today, It was really exciting.": "surprise", "That's really cool! Was it your first game ever?": "joy", "No, I use to play growing up. I haven't been to a game since graduating highschool. ": "joy", "Well I think it really cool that you were able to get back into something that you used to do when you were younger!": "sadness", "I was on a run today, and saw a loose dog but couldn't catch it before it ran off!": "fear", "That's so interesting because I saw someone post the same thing on a neighborhood app just today.  Is that you? ha ha.": "disgusted", "Maybe if you live in Central Texas...haha! But I was so worried about that small dog getting hit!": "joy", "Ha ha, guess you weren't the one.  That would've been crazy!  I hope its okay!  I'm sure someone will try to grab it.": "sadness", "I got some bad news today, my dad passed away.": "sadness", "oh my goodness thats terrible, i am so sorry!": "sadness", "Thank you, I am a mess.

You think you could scream for help during those times, but a lot of people actually don't.": "fear", "Im watching the show The Bold Type, my favourtie characters dad died :(": "sadness", "is that a good show? i have never heard of it": "joy", "Yes, it's a great girly drama! Reminds me of Sex in the City but Modern.": "joy", "nice! what channel?": "joy", "It's been a great night!

Do you like your new neighborhood?": "joy", "Yes, there are a lot of kids that our daughter can play with. ": "sadness", "That is great. Why did you move?": "joy", "We had been saving for 4 years to buy a bigger house. We had outgrown our other home. ": "sadness", "I had a doctors appointment today.": "anticipation", "I'm not a fan of doctors most of the time - how did it go?": "anticipation", "I was so mad because I had to wait a hour after my appointment time before they called me back. ": "anger", "I cannot stand that - they should not schedule people so close together if they can't handle that pace.": "anger", "I agree! Everyone was so annoyed because we were all waiting forever. ": "anger", "I had just moved in to my new apartment, and every night this skinny little tabby came begging for food at my door.": "trust", "Aww - did you feed the cat?": "sadness", "At first I tried to resist, but I ended up adopting him!": "joy", "That's how we have our cat also - how funny!  They are just irrestible at some point aren't they?": "sadness", "I received a wrong number call last night at 2 in the morning. ": "sadness", "Ugh!

": "sadness", "Oh no!  I can't even imagine that - was everyone ok?": "sadness", "Yes, thankfully everybody was safe. Nobody was even home when it happened. ": "trust", "I'm so glad that everyone was ok.  But I know that was devastating - did you rebuild?": "sadness", "No, we just bought another house closer to town. It was sad losing everything that we had. ": "sadness", "When me and my friend got lost in the desert, I thought we were done for.": "sadness", "scary! how long were you lost for?": "fear", "Only a couple of hours. We flagged down an old Chevy truck and the man driving got us sorted out.": "sadness", "oh good... I was imagining days": "fear", "I went tonight to meet my daughters teacher.

Do you still look awesome like you did back then?": "sadness", "Well.... maybe not as awesome. lol But I do try to keep in shape. It was good seeing all my old friends. ": "sadness", "Yeah I bet.  Do you still keep in touch with any of them?": "sadness", "I do a lot of them but some have moved away and we just lost touch. ": "sadness", "Yeah.

She decided she would delegate some work to me by slamming on my desk and demanding I do it. She had some nerve!": "anger", "Did you get mad at her?": "anger", "Yes, she doesn't have the right to do that. I have been that many years longer than her, and it was her work!

Luckily, the baby and I weren't hurt, but I wanted to waddle away so fast!": "sadness", "Oh no!

I need to get a good grade!": "joy", "What class is it?": "joy", "I have to give a speech on Thursday.": "joy", "Are you prepared?": "joy", "Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.": "joy", "I relate, what is the speech on?": "joy", "It's on local politics. Not a fun subject either!": "joy", "I sold some stuff I didnt need last week.": "sadness", "did yo make some good money?": "joy", "Yea, enought to have great weekened anyway.": "joy", "I cold use some money like that": "trust", "I think that my husband and me have so much faith in each other.": "trust", "thats awesome to hear, a lot of people cheat on each other frequently and dont care anymore": "trust", "I know, I cant do that. I think it's very important to be honest in your love life.": "trust", "i believe so too , if people are gonna cheat why get married at all": "trust", "Ten years ago now, a massive hurricane forced my family to evacuate. I didn't know if there would be anything to come back to.": "fear", "That's awful, but better safe than sorry. How were things when you came back?": "sadness", "Pretty messed up, but the house was still standing.": "anger", "That's a silver lining in all of it at least! ": "anger", "was travelling 14 hours internationally. First flight got delayed and the airline would not apologize and provide altenative": "sadness", "That's terrible. I thought they had to offer some sort of alternative. What airline was it?": "sadness", "British airways. they claimed because they dont have ties to the connecting, they could not": "anger", "I've never trusted British Airways. ": "sadness", "I've felt excited when I found out I had won a place on a prestigious creative writing course, taught by someone who I knew could help me in ways that I would I not be able to through self-study alone.": "joy", "You are so lucky to be talented enough to achieve such an honor. Was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be?": "joy", "Thank you for the kind words. You know what? It was, but not for the reasons I imagined! It turned out that everyone in the class developed a really close bond and while the advice from the teacher was wonderful, it was the lifelong friendships and mutual edits that the students do for each other that has proved equally special! ": "sadness", "Sounds like it was a once in a lifetime experience.": "trust", "I think it was :)": "joy", "I like going fishing, it reminds me of when I would go with my dad when I was a kid.": "sadness", "Do you have any kids?": "sadness", "I do, I have a 6 month old boy. How about you?": "joy", "I have 3- I bet you can't wait to take him fishing.": "joy", "I dropped all my food in the cafeteria the other day. Everybody was staring at me.": "sadness", "Was it at college?": "sadness", "No, it was at work.": "sadness", "OH wow! Did you get it all over youself?": "fear", "I once accidently ran down the battery on my car when I mid-judged how long I could run the radio for without the engine running. It was 5am and I was in the middle of nowhere. I called the first person I could think of who could help and they came with crocodile clips and recharged the battery. I felt so grateful to be on the receiving end of a kind act. I was also embarrassed that I had let that happen and I learned from it! ": "joy", "That sounds like a really stressful situation. It's really good to know that there are still helpful people out there!": "trust", "Yeah for sure! It was one of those things that once it happens once then you definitely know the limits of the car's battery power without engine running - so you make sure it won't happen again!": "fear", "I'm glad you've put a positive spin on it :) ": "sadness", "I'm ready for college football to start. I can't wait for kickoff weekend!": "joy", "Who do you support? ": "anticipation", "Auburn Tigers": "joy", "Cool. Do you play football too?": "joy", "I did something really foolish at the grocery store yesterday.": "sadness", "Oh no! What did you do?": "sadness", "I was reaching for some pasta sauce and knocked a few of them over. They shattered on the ground a such a huge mess that two workers had to come mop it up.": "sadness", "Oh yikes! That's a bummer. I'm sure the employees see that kind of thing all the time, though.": "sadness", "I can't believe he did it! I just went to my brother's graduation ceremony at Princeton.": "surprise", "Oh that's super excited! I'm sure you're really proud of him.": "joy", "Oh yeah, definitely! He put in a ton of work and it all paid off!": "joy", "That's super great to hear! Well deserved.": "joy", "I once had a long walk home from the railway station with two very heavy bags. It turned out that another person had also missed the last bus and had to walk much of the journey with me as his home was in the same direction as mine. The two bags I had had some expensive DJ equipment but they were VERY heavy so when they guy who had to walk home the same way said he would help by carrying one of the bags I trusted him! He didn't disappoint, he helped me get home earlier and without a bad back; while the kindness of strangers made what a potentially bad night to a reasonably pleasant one - all down to trust!": "trust", "What a nice guy.  There are fewer and fewer of those every day.": "trust", "It's one of those things that in the day time you might expect but this was like 1am so I'm sure he would have wanted to get home as soon as he could but he chose to make his night harder to make my night easier. ": "sadness", "Are you goings going to stay friends?": "sadness", "I was really mad when I walked out my door the other day to go to work and my neighbors big dog jumped up on me and knocked me over.": "anger", "Did you get hurt?": "sadness", "Yes, I hurt my back and couldn't even go to work. Shouldn't the dog be on a leash. Ugh!": "sadness", "I hope you get better soon!": "sadness", "My transmission in my car went out the other day, maybe it won't be too expensive to repair.": "anger", "That's never fun!  Large unexpected expenses are the worst": "trust", "Yes they are. I had just put a down payment on a house too, so my money is tied up.": "anger", "Oh no! At least you have something to look forward to, the new house!": "sadness", "I am fuming. I saw someone key my car while I was at the grocery store the other day.": "anger", "Oh no! What a terrible thing to have happen! Were you able to confront them?": "anger", "No, I was checking out when I saw it happen. I didn't even know them. I don't know why anyone would do something like that.": "anger", "That is just awful. Now you'll have to pay to have it repaired. ": "anger", "Had my first trekking expereince in the canyon last week. It payed off using all the things i learned during the scouts when i was small!": "joy", "Nice. Did you like it?": "surprise", "I did. the scenes were really rewarding. also felt good to have all the tools and skills necessary ": "trust", "Last week I saw a three piece rock band that sounded so huge that I was sure they were playing with a backing track. I asked their tech, and checked their equipment and guess what!? It was just them!": "surprise", "It was who,who were them?": "anger", "I'm sorry if I was unclear, I mean that the band were playing completely live (with no backing track).": "sadness", "Ok,thats amusing": "sadness", "So I learned to bowl using two hands yesterday and it was my best game ever!": "joy", "Wow! thats great! I bet you feel proud of it!": "joy", "Yes, very! It's also way more fun for me to put spin on the ball than traditional style bowling.": "surprise", "I bet you were full of joy and laughter yesterday! ": "surprise", "So I came home to dog poop everywhere yesterday! It was gross!": "disgusted", "Oh no! Were you gone for long?": "sadness", "We were only gone for 2 hours! You just can't leave them alone I guess": "sadness", "What a bad doggie... hopefully they don't do it again": "sadness", "I am starting a new phase in my life. Completed all debt and off to a new start": "joy", "I can hear the sigh of relief in your voice. I bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be. ": "fear", "yes very. but I know that it will be good. ": "joy", "I can tell your proud of yourself. Im happy for you!": "joy", "Thanks! I hope to learn from my mistake and continue to progress": "sadness", "You will be fine! Stay optimistic about it": "anticipation", "I try to be. it can be difficult on some days, but I think I have a good attitude towards most things": "anticipation", "I agree, but having great joy in life helps": "trust", "I'm feeling very motivated and good about school this year. I think I can get much better grades this time.": "joy", "It's good you're motivated! That's a step in the right direction": "joy", "Thanks! I've realized that school is extremely important and I can't squander my opportunity away.": "joy", "I agree. I wish I could go back to school and pay more attention": "sadness", "My friend bought a house in a very cheap market town and 6 months later a very walthy company opened an enormous regional HQ there. His house has doubled in price and he has paid off all his debt and now is very well off. I'm pleased for him but envy a little luck": "surprise", "That's amazing and a very quick profit!  I'm a little bit jealous myself.  ": "anger", "Yeah. It is one of those strange moments where a place can go from being a place in the cheapest third of housing markets to being in the most expensive third in just a couple years!": "joy", "It's amazing the effect something so seemingly small, like the company headquarters opening, can effect an entire town like that": "joy", "So yesterday I went bowling and the ball got stuck on my hand... I went with it.": "sadness", "Yikes.  Did you get injured?": "fear", "No, but I was shocked at how a small 12 pound ball can carry you down the lane due to the momentum. It was quite funny.": "surprise", "Yeah and the lanes are really slick.  That's pretty funny and maybe a little embarassing too.": "anger", "My brother got a nice new toyota 4runner for his first car! I'm lowkey kind of mad at him for it.": "anger", "I would be too! That's a really nice car for his first car!": "surprise", "No kidding! I hope he understands the value of it!": "joy", "I do too. Maybe he will left you drive it!": "anger", "I just got a new car and I absolutely love it! My old car was a piece of crap so an upgrade is awesome!": "surprise", "Wow you must be so happy! Nothing like a new car": "joy", "I am very happy! It's nice to know that I don't have to worry about if my car is going to start or not either.": "joy", "HAving a reliable car really changes things for the best": "trust", "I was listening to a throwback hits playlist and it brought back memories from the good ol days.": "sadness", "Nice! What genre of playlist was it? ": "joy", "It was mostly hip hop and R&B. Stuff like Nelly Furtado, 2pac, etc.": "joy", "Cool! I like to rediscover old playlists I made when I was younger.": "joy", "My grandson was admitted to the hospital the other day. It's so hard waiting around for test results.": "anticipation", "I can only imagine! How is he now?": "sadness", "They still have more tests to do. Hopefully they will know something by tomorrow but it's so nerve wracking.": "fear", "Doctor's are good at what they do! I hope for a speedy diagnosis and recovery!": "fear", "I am so excited - after a year of misery due to my loud, inconsiderate upstairs neighbors I'm finally moving into a new apartment!": "joy", "That is great news!  I bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new.": "joy", "I just can't wait! I've seen the new place, and it backs onto a forest, so there'll be peace there, at least!": "fear", "It is always exciting to move into a new place and make it your own": "joy", "Yes it is. And friends are going to help me with moving. It'll be great fun - we can have a bit of a party while they help me unpack :)": "joy", "I was bowling last week and I accidentally used the person's custom ball that was next to me!": "sadness", "oh , how he reacted next": "anger", "It was a she! And she just glared at me. I felt awful when I realized my mistake.": "sadness", "its ok it happens with every one": "sadness", "We have a family reunion planned for next week. I am really looking forward to catching up with everyone, especially my brother and sister.": "joy", "Yes, that will be awesome! How long has it been since you've seen everyone?": "joy", "It's been over a year and we don't get to talk very often because everyone is always so busy. I'm so excited.": "joy", "That's fantastic that you get to see everyone again! I hope you have a great time catching up.": "joy", "I recently hit a new personal record at the gym! I was very excited.": "joy", "That is a great accomplishment. I admire your dedication in obtaining that goal.": "joy", "Thank you! I didn't feel like I would ever be able to do it, but consistency does seem to pay off.": "joy", "It's really hard to stick with something like that. I wish I could do it.": "trust", "I have a feeling that the rest of this year is going to be great to me! I'm already working out and just have good vibes about the upcoming months.": "anticipation", "That great to hear! Have you started a work out program before?": "joy", "I have but I've never really stuck to it. This time is different though, I've been going for a few months and feeling great about the future": "joy", "You can do it! Don't forget to reward yourself for all of your hard work!": "joy", "My brother got a custom-made bowling ball, and ever since then he's been killing the game! It is awesome to see.": "surprise", "Sounds impressive, does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions?": "surprise", "He's on his high school bowling team, but I think he mainly plays for fun. It's kind of cool seeing him get so much better over time.": "surprise", "Very nice, I would be proud too.": "joy", "Ok, so the people upstairs were making a terrible noise last night and I'd had enough. I put jazz on quite loudly and went to bed. I really shouldn't have done that!": "sadness", "oh no what happened?": "sadness", "Well, they were shouting and stomping around, so I lost it! This morning, they've been quiet as church mice, so I guess it worked :)": "sadness", "that would really help if it was a permanent solution": "anger", "Yeah, I really do feel bad, but it's been going on for over a year.": "sadness", "yeah enough is enough. i totally can't say i blame you.": "sadness", "Perhaps I'll try classical music next time - that might totally shut them up, lol.": "sadness", "bwahaha not to mention it will help you get some relaxing sleep.": "anger", "I was watching my dad's house last week and I heard some odd noises while I was there alone.": "fear", "I hate creepy stuff like that because I get paranoid.": "fear", "No kidding! Once I came back to the kitchen and the faucet was running even though I hadn't touched it.": "fear", "That sounds more odd than what I am used too. Hopefully nothing paranormal is going on.": "fear", "I didn't see my parents since 2014! They live in a different country. I'm finally going to see them next week and I Just CAN'T wait!!": "anticipation", "That will be an amazing trip!!": "joy", "I know! And they've never met their grandson so they will be so excited to finally meet him": "joy", "That will be so great for them - I can just imagine meeting my granson for the first time - what a sweet time you are about to have.": "joy", "I can't help but think back to the good old days at Christmas time.": "sadness", "Christmas was always a nightmare for me.": "fear", "I'm sorry. That makes me really sad. We lived in a great neighborhood growing up and our neighbors were like family and always got together to celebrate.": "sadness", "I cried every year knowing santa wasnt coming to my house.": "sadness", "The last time I went into a job interview, I knew as soon as I walked out that I would be getting a job offer. I felt I did really well.": "joy", "That is great! It's so awesome to feel confident after an interview!": "joy", "Definitely. You go through so many it's easy to feel down.": "sadness", "Yes it sure is. Did you end up getting the job?": "joy", "Last winter I was out on my porch at 4 am. Suddenly a large figure dressed in black was walking towards me. My heart was beating like a drum!": "fear", "Was it a ghost?": "fear", "I wasn't sure at first and, being in a wheelchair, had nowhere to go. Then the dark figure stopped in front of me. I thought I'd had it. Turns out it was my neighbor who couldn't sleep, walking her dog!": "fear", "Oh,that was so hillarious": "sadness", "It is now. But it sure wasn't at the time. I was frantically looking around for something to beat my \"attacker\" off with!": "anger", "I stress eat a lot. I decided i need to control it and i didn't eat sweets for more than a week. very proud of myself": "joy", "That's great, keep it up if you can!": "joy", "I'll try to do my best. i think i will also need to see a doctor. I just don't wanna get obese": "anticipation", "It's good that you're being more proactive about your health now.": "sadness", "My co-worker just bought a brand new car. ": "anger", "Man, i wish i could get one.": "sadness", "I know, me too. I really envy them every day when I get in my beat up chevy that I've been driving for 10 years.": "anger", "I also drive a chevy and have had it forever as well.": "joy", "i wanna sell my phone so i posted ad on craigslist. i have 3 potential buyers but i'm so scared to meet them . you never know what people intentions are": "fear", "Have you ever sold on Craigslist before? I always have the people meet me in the Walmart parking lot during the day. I have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that. ": "anger", "I did but my husband was with me and now he is out of the country for a couple of months so  i will be alone": "sadness", "It will be okay. You could also have the people meet you at the local police station. The police do not mind and would rather you feel safe.": "anger", "I am moving into a new apartment in three weeks and can't wait. It'll be quiet as it looks onto a forest!": "anticipation", "Is it loud where you are now?  New places are always so fun!": "joy", "Not with traffic, but with the people upstairs - they're a cross between hyenas and elephants!. My new place was quiet when I was there, so fingers crossed!": "surprise", "OH that will be such a huge relief I'm sure!  It's crazy that people behave that way, knowing they are causing other people such strife.": "anger", "They're the most selfish, inconsiderate neighbors I have ever had, and I've lived all over the world! I just cannot wait to get into this other place.": "anger", "Someone stole my identity.": "anger", "Oh no! How did that happen and how much damage did they do?": "sadness", "I don't know. They completely cleaned out my bank account and maxed out my credit cards. I am fuming.": "disgusted", "That is horrible! What will you do?": "sadness", "i have food on my table, a roof over my head and clothes to wear. I'm happy and thankful": "trust", "That is truly all you can ask for.": "anger", "yes. Some people take these things for granted. it's really easy to take things and people for granted": "trust", "I try to never take anything in life for granted. ": "trust", "so i decided to make a blanket and i got a sawing machine and got patterns and stuff. it tuned out to be so easy! I actually made 3 blankets": "joy", "Wow, impressive. You must have natural talent. Do you plan to make more? ": "joy", "thank you! I do want to take more and to give them to my friends who recently had babies": "trust", "You can always sell them as well. I live in Amish country in PA and the Amish sell blankets for hundreds of dollars each.": "joy", "I remember being in Scotland and arranging a trip to California to see my then boyfriend. I was so very happy to be seeing him again!": "joy", "I bet! Is it hard to have a long distance relationship?": "trust", "Very hard and this was before the days of smartphones and FaceTime. We spent a fortune on telephone calls. But it was so worth it to speak to each other and I was lucky I could afford to fly out to see him.": "sadness", "I can only image how hard that was before the days of smartphones! I'm glad you were able to visit him!": "sadness", "Me too. That was one of the happiest trips of my life. The happiest was when we got married six months later!": "sadness", "When I spend time with my family, it reminds me how lucky I really am.": "sadness", "Aww. It's the things money can't buy that bring us the greatest joy, no?": "sadness", "Definitely. Even when times get rough, there are still so many things to be thankful for. I did not always realize that, but glad I do now.": "trust", "That is so true and it's a good perspective to have.": "sadness", "My dog just gave me a bunch of kisses! I love her so much": "trust", "Dogs really are such great companions, what breed is she?": "trust", "She is a golden retriever. Do you have any pets?": "surprise", "Yes I have a miniature pinscher, he just turned 15.": "sadness", "School starts a week from tomorrow and I am getting fairly nervous for it!": "fear", "how come? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start": "joy", "Oh yes, I really like school and my classmates and stuff! I guess just because summer is coming to an end?": "joy", "the summer is horrid. heat, sweat, mosquitos, rain, and crowds everywhere": "anger", "I always say i'm not a judgemental person but in my head i judge everybody and i'm so ahsamed of it": "anger", "I do the same! I think everyone does.": "joy", "yes but when i catch myself judging somebody i feel so guilty and bad": "sadness", "I think it's a normal human activity. You don't need to feel bad": "joy", "I've already gotten my school supplies and everything is ready! I feel like I'm gonna kill this semester.": "joy", "That's the way to do it!  Be prepared to kick it's butt and get good grades!": "joy", "I will try! It will be hard with a part-time job but I bet I can manage.": "sadness", "Always put your school first, you will be thankful you did later!": "joy", "My brother just turned 16 and he's about to get his first car! I'm so excited for him.": "surprise", "Whoa that's exciting!  What kind of car we looking at?": "joy", "Probably some kind of SUV, maybe an Xterra or 4runner. Should be awesome when he gets it!": "joy", "That's a really good/safe first car.": "trust", "I've been saving up for a new car for the past month and am making great progress!": "joy", "Thats awesome!  What kind of car do you want": "joy", "I want an SUV, like an Xterra or 4runner. They are pricy though!": "trust", "Well I really hope you are able to save up and get it soon!": "anticipation", "Recently my husband and I were traveling home from visiting his family when all of a sudden a car cuts us off": "sadness", "That's annoying, I hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road.": "anger", "I have no idea how we didn't hit them but it was so scary": "fear", "I'm glad that you are okay! Keep your eyes peeled for terrible drivers.": "anger", "My oldest child's birthday is next week and it always makes me emotional.": "sadness", "I can imagine. How old will they be?": "sadness", "She will be 30. It makes me feel so old, but also how fun it was when they were little.": "sadness", "Yeah but also just think of all the amazing movies she has done. ": "joy", "I feel so much better about myself and life in general now that I": "sadness", "Now that you what? Tell me!": "joy", "Sorry, I accidentally hit enter haha. Now that I've been working out for about a month!": "sadness", "Oh that is great! I've heard that exercise can really help mentally and physically!": "joy", "I just enjoyed grocery shopping for the first time in a very long time. I've found my perfect restaurant/store and spent a very happy 40 mins or so wandering around it.": "trust", "That's great! Did you get anything you are especially excited about? It's a restaurant and a store?": "joy", "Yes, it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans, which are delicious!": "joy", "Dragon tongue beans! I've never heard of them! What do they look like?": "fear", "They're the same shape as regular green beans, but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.": "joy", "I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live, but this is new to me. ": "trust", "What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange, different things to try!": "joy", "It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?": "joy", "I came home from work last night and my step dad scared me!": "fear", "How did he scare you?": "fear", "Like he jumped out from behind a door and scared me. I was not expecting it!": "surprise", "I bet that gave you a good scare! Gotta love dads and step dads!": "fear", "My step dad showed me a cut he got while working on his boat and I could see his muscle fibers. I almost puked.": "disgusted", "Oh that sounds disgusting! ": "disgusted", "Yeah it was gross. He probably should get stitches.": "disgusted", "I hope he gets that taken care of!": "anger", "When I heard Anthony Bourdin had taken his own life, I was so shocked and upset. He gave so much pleasure to a lot of people, yet was miserable in his own life.": "surprise", "I think we never really know what is going on inside people's mind. Celebrities like Anthony and Robin Williams seems to live a good life, but in reality, they are suffering.": "surprise", "It's awful. I really wish far more resources were put toward mental health facilities and counselling in this country!": "trust", "I completely agree! I think it would even help lower crime rates.": "disgusted", "Most definitely. We actually need these resources to get mentally disturbed people off the streets and get them the help they deserve.": "trust", "All around, it would be a good decision for society. Just last night, I was watching Live PD and there was a young man stealing a candy bar. He was a drug addict. I believe if he had the help he needed, he would not have to steal tiny amounts of food.": "trust", "There's so much we could be doing to help those in need and yet our politicians (on both sides!) are off helping the rich and corporations - it's disgusting.": "anger", "I hadn't been able to see my grandmother in quite some time b/c she lives so far away": "sadness", "Oh no. I'm so sorry. Can you video chat with her?": "sadness", "Well I was finally able to go and visit her and the house and visit was exactly as I remembered it as a child.  It gave me such great memories!": "sadness", "How wonderful. That's what's important and makes life meaningful in my opinion.": "joy", "I remember being on holiday and trying to find a way to watch an F1 race. I caught the beginning of the race in a bar before it closed and saw that my favourite driver had had a puncture and fallen to last place. My mate asked me what the chances were of him winning from that position? I said 1000 to 1. By the time we were back at the hostel, I learned that he had indeed won the race in what many believe was the greatest single event in the sport's history!": "joy", "Wow! That is insane, too bad you didn't bet with those kind of odds.": "disgusted", "Yeah, for sure! It was one of those nights where we were journey is what's fun rather than what you were aiming to do, if you get me. We went from sports bar to sports bar trying to see who would show the event and by the time we gave up we'd had such a funny night and the race had turned out great!": "joy", "That sounds like a great time, one of those nights you always remember!": "joy", "I didn't know until the other day that kids have different teachers for different subjects starting in 5th grae.": "joy", "Yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get. I think it's good because they get a variety.": "surprise", "That's true.  I was a little startled b/c I don't remember changing classes for things until 7th grade.  Just a reminder that kids grow up so much faster now.": "sadness", "Yeah schools definitely start things younger now. Kindergarten used to be voluntary back in the day!": "anticipation", "That's true - when I was in kindergarten, we only went for half the day.": "sadness", "When I lived in California my farmer friend and landlord had me get organized and have all my valuables together in case of a big earthquake. He stockpiled such things as batteries and water.": "surprise", "I can understand that as I live in Florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies.": "joy", "It feels good to get everything together, doesn't it? You feel as if you're ready for anything!": "joy", "Yes, you are correct. You can always \"hope\" for the best, but also \"plan\" for the worst. Being prepared is a comfortable feeling.": "joy", "I like that saying - it's very good advice. I'm all for advance action as it saves headaches (or worse!) later on.": "trust", "i'm so proud of my son! He learned a couple of words this week. He now knows how to ay please": "joy", "That's wonderful, they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages.": "joy", "he actually speaks 2 languages. I teach him english and russian": "joy", "Wow! That's impressive and a lasting skill for your child to develop.": "joy", "A while back my loud upstairs neighbors went away for a week. My life went from night to day. It just felt as if all was right in my world.": "fear", "Did you think about moving after that?": "fear", "Funny you should mention that - in three weeks time, lol.": "joy", "haha are you serious? Did you move in with your girlfriend?": "sadness", "No, moving to a 1-bedroom apartment. I don't have a girlfriend - I had a husband, but we split up.": "sadness", "I found a cat in my attic yesterday!": "sadness", "Oh wow! I hope that it was ok!": "fear", "My husband is allergic to cats to, I'm not sure how it got there. We had to call animal control to get it out safely!": "fear", "Oh no. That sounds really stressful!": "fear", "My best friend's long-term relationship ended abruptly a while back, just after her father passed. I'm so full of admiration for her - instead of turning to drink or becoming crazy-depressed, she pulled herself together and made a new, exciting life her new reality.": "sadness", "That is very unusual. She should be proud of herself.": "joy", "Yes, she should. She joined a community garden and helps out there, she got a part time job and took up badminton - not something she'd ever done before!": "surprise", "Wow, I wish more would follow her example. That's a recovery.": "sadness", "She's a very strong person and she also has lots of friends and family to help her. She's a lovely person and deserves the best in life!": "trust", "I just got Hulu Live. It's been amazing to watch TV again!": "surprise", "I haven't watched actual TV in sooo long. What do you watch on Hulu?": "surprise", "I love to watch Home shows on HGTV and Bachelor in Paridise on ABC. Hulu live has been a great value for the price!": "sadness", "That's real neat, I might check it out. I've only ever used Netflix, but Netflix is pretty good too.": "sadness", "My husband ran over a cat this morning on accident, I'm so upset.": "sadness", "Aw, I bet he feels horrible about it.  Poor kitty!": "sadness", "Yes, we had to call animal control to retreive the body! I hope it wasn't someone pet.": "sadness", "Aw, that's always sad, I lost a cat once and I assume that's what happened to her ;(": "sadness", "I couldn't imagine losing all 3 of my kids in a fire.": "sadness", "That would be horrific.  Do you know someone that this happened to?": "disgusted", "Yes, I heard about it. Such a sad story.": "sadness", "That is just horrible.  I think they would have to medicate me for the rest of my life if that happendd.": "anger", "My friends threw an unexpected birthday party for me. I thought they'd forgotten..": "surprise", "That is nice of your friend. I hope you enjoyed it.": "trust", "I did! It was a very nice gesture.": "trust", "You can return the favor one day. That is what friends are for!": "sadness", "We are waiting on military orders right now, I'm so hoping they come through next week.": "anticipation", "Do you have any idea where you will go? Is it accompanied?": "fear", "Yes, we know where we are going just haven't gotten the official orders.": "surprise", "Well I hope they get there soon so you don't have to wait longer.": "sadness", "I get so tired of hearing about people being mean to animals.": "sadness", "I'm with you on this one.  What is up with people these days, I just don't understand how they could do that.": "sadness", "Right, these poor animals have no clue why people are mean to them. Some people are heartless.": "disgusted", "I think there should be stiffer penalties for people that do things like that, for instance more jail time.": "anger", "For some reason I've been thinking of our family Christmases back when I was a kid. I so enjoyed decorating the tree, helping my Mom with preparing lunch. And of course, eating Christmas lunch! Fun times.": "joy", "i had a similar experience, i miss it too": "sadness", "It's nice to think back, tho' and relive the old days. We have our own traditions now, but the good old days will always remain just that!": "sadness", "i totally agree": "anger", "It's funny, we always remember the successful, fun times and forget about the not-so-perfect things. Must be our minds' defense kicking in! ": "joy", "Do you know anyone who spends a ton on eating out every week? It's crazy to me how much they spend.": "sadness", "I know that when just the 4 people in my family do go out, it runs us about $65.  So we do it very rarely, it wastes a lot of money.": "sadness", "Yes, exactly. A friend was telling me they spent almost $300 a week on eating out. I don't even spend that much on groceries. ": "sadness", "A week!?  That is just crazy, and pretty irresponsible unless you are a millionaire.": "joy", "We are moving soon and I'm so ready to go.": "joy", "Where to?": "joy", "Texas, there's so much to do there so I'm happy for the change. ": "joy", "I spent some time there, when I was learning how to be an Army Medic. I really enjoyed my time there!": "joy", "Awesome, my husband is Air Force and we have been in Mississippi for 4 years. Texas sounds better.": "joy", "I was worried because the weather man said a hurricane was coming. So we got everything ready just in case.": "joy", "It's better to be safe than sorry. You can't overprepare.": "sadness", "So true. Luckily it didn't get as bad as they thought so we didn't have to evauate.": "fear", "I am glad you didn't get hit. I know how stressful hurricanes can be.": "fear", "My cousin contacted me the other day via Facebook messenger. She had my twin aunts with her, one of whom I hadn't seen in over five years. It was such a delight to see them and chat with them!": "surprise", "I bet! I hope you were able to catch up!": "surprise", "Oh yes, and then some! They both looked so well and had lots to say. What a laugh we had. I'm so fortunate to have such a wonderful family!": "trust", "You are very lucky!": "joy", "Yes I am! When I hear how some families are I feel very blessed. They are very special people.": "trust", "My dog has to have her teeth cleaned on Wednesday and I am really nervous b/c she got super sick last time afterwards ": "fear", "That's strange, I hope she makes it out ok this time though.": "sadness", "She is super tiny and they said with small dogs the stress of the procedure will give them stomach issues sometimes.  I wouldnt even do it except she has an abcess": "trust", "Oh wow, I would never consider something like that hurting a dog.": "disgusted", "Recently my grandma passed away.  she lived pretty far from us most of our lives but at the end she had Alzheimer and so we moved her down to be near us": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she passed peacefully.": "sadness", "Yes, it seemed so.  I really had fun reconnecting with her as an adult, so it was really hard when she passed.": "sadness", "I am sure she appreciated your visit before her passing. She must have felt loved.": "trust", "We broke down and couldn't get help for several hours as we were out of cell range. Good thing I had packed extra food and water.": "joy", "That was a really smart call on your part! Were you worried?": "fear", "I was very worried but we were lucky eventually and someone stopped and helped and we went on with our vacation.": "trust", "Well, it was a very smart thing you did packing those extra supplies.": "joy", "I've been so busy packing, packing and more packing. ": "joy", "That sounds pretty stressful. Are you moving soon?": "fear", "Yes, don't know exactly when but I hate being rushed so I've been doing what I can.": "fear", "That makes sense. I hate leaving things for the last second as well. Hopefully you won't have to leave everything boxed up for too long.": "sadness", "I recently got married to my best friend. We are older now and are happy with things being low key and staying on a routine.": "joy", "That is great! You are lucky!": "joy", "I do feel very lucky, especially to find someone who is as satisfied as I am in our old age.": "trust", "It is a wonderful thing that you have someone to share your life with.": "trust", "I got to hear a lot of cool songs on a radio station I usually don't listen to.": "sadness", "Nice! Which ones did you hear!": "joy", "Mambo #5, Missy Elliot, and Ricky Martin. It really took me back": "sadness", "That one is a zinger! I remember listening to that when I took my grandma to prom!": "sadness", "I took a test for college the other day, it was basically our midterm.": "fear", "I don't know yet. The wait is killing me and I'm not confident I did well.": "anticipation", "Im sure you did fine. what was the subject?": "joy", "Discrete mathematics ": "joy", "I was watching the Scottish Open golf tournament a few weeks ago. I know a guy who was playing in it. Guess what? He won! Fantastic four days of baited breath and cheering him on!": "surprise", "That is great! Can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together?": "joy", "He's playing in the PGA Championship right now or I'm sure he'd be delighted to, lol!": "joy", "Well yeah, that sounds about right. He has to go to the Championship first and win, then party time !!!!!": "joy", "You got it! I've been watching him play for a while now and it's such a fantastic feeling to see him win - and in his own country too!": "joy", "It is really could to see friends live out their dreams! I will be cheering for him and the team!": "surprise", "Thank you - he'd appreciate it. It makes tournaments so much more interesting when you know some people involved.": "joy", "I love teaching people how to skydive - it is so much fun helping them to learn.": "trust", "That's sound like a lot of fun! Do you know where I can go get lessons?": "joy", "There are skydiving centers all over the world.  What part of the country are you in?  It is an amazing sport.": "joy", "I am in VA. I have been looking into it for quite awhile, but I think I'd be too chicken to jump out of the plane.": "fear", "There is Skydive Orange and Virginia Skydiving Center.  I grew up near Richmond!": "trust", "Everyone in my family laughs at me b/c I am super organized and I like routine in my life": "joy", "Nothing wrong with that.

I always joke that I use to be a boyscout b/c their motto is \"Always be prepared\"": "anger", "It drives me nuts when people are disorganized. My husband is hopeless - I could throttle him sometimes!": "anger", "You know when you see the perfect house to rent and someone beats you to it? That happened to me recently - the owners rented it out the night before I was to see it :(": "sadness", "Oh man that is really annoying!  Have you found another one you like yet?": "anger", "Yes, but it's an apartment and this place was a lovely quiet 3 bed/2 bath place in a lovely neighborhood. Such a bummer!": "sadness", "Oh man I would be so upset.  I totally understand!  I hope you will be able to enjoy your new place": "sadness", "I'm sure I will so long as I have good neighbors.

Good guess though :P": "joy", "*wink* *wink* ": "sadness", "My wife is coming back into the country after being away for 2 months.  I've got to do some cleaning before she gets back :P": "joy", "Ha, yeah gotta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home... other wise there's going to be a price to pay.": "sadness", "Most definitely.  I'm not worried about her being terribly mad, but it's nice to come home to a clean house.": "disgusted", "It always is, plus it gives you some brownie points as well.": "joy", "i burned my hair with my hair drier i am so embarrased to go out in public": "sadness", "I am sorry to hear that, my wife has done the same thing.

I don't do it too often, so it was a bummer.": "sadness", "That doesn't sound good. What happened that was so bad?": "sadness", "The food was pretty bad and the service didn't help clear things up.  There were a lot of mistakes on top of everything.  Just general bad eating out things.": "sadness", "That sounds like an awful experience. I probably wouldn't go back there anytime soon.": "sadness", "I was walking through the grocery store the other day and wasn't watching where I was going and knocked over an entire display.": "sadness", "Oh lord. Did you try to set it back up, or did you try to sneak away?": "fear", "It was too much of a mess to clean up and I couldn't sneak away because there were several people who saw me do it.

It was a horrible feeling.": "sadness", "That sucks. Why did you move from california?": "sadness", "My rent tripled in three years. I couldn't afford to stay - just too expensive. Anyway, a friend had driven across with me and it wasn't until he'd gone that I realized I was alone. Silly, huh?!": "sadness", "That's really common actually. There's a big exodus from there.  They voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high.": "sadness", "The two things I found that were really bad were rents and gas. Everything else was pretty much the same as other places I've lived. So sad - where I lived was lovely.": "sadness", "The weather is nice in parts of california, I've been there.": "joy", "The North is my favorite area - north of San Francisco. Where did you go?": "joy", "My sister got married at Laguna niguel": "surprise", "A while ago I drove from Florida to Northern California. It's a long trip, but I knew I could do it just fine.": "joy", "That is a long trip.  Did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks?": "joy", "It took about 5 days. I would drive a few hours and stop for the night. I'd already made the trip from West to East, so kind of knew what I was doing.": "fear", "That's not bad, I was thinking you were doing it in like a couple days.": "sadness", "Oh no - I'm not a race car driver, lol. And anyway, it's kind of fun seeing different parts of the country, so rushing would (to me) be a waste.": "anger", "My wife was really sick the other day, she was stuck in bed for most of the day.": "trust", "Oh, poor lady. I do hope she's feeling better. What was wrong with her, if you don't mind my asking?": "sadness", "Not completely sure, maybe just a stomach bug or something.  She's ok now, though her appetite took a bit to come back.": "disgusted", "Well, I'm really glad to hear she's recovered. Stomach bugs are awful - they really take their toll on you.": "sadness", "summer was so boring for me, im really happy school is starting again": "sadness", "Why was it boring, nothing exciting to do where you live?": "sadness", "not really, i just stayed home all summer because my parents worked the whole summer as well as i did": "joy", "Ah yeah, that sucks. No time for anything fun.": "sadness", "My mom is having weight loss surgery next week, I'm nervous.": "fear", "What kind of operation is it? I'm unfamiliar with weight loss surgery. But typically surgeries like that are very safe, but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about.": "fear", "She is having gastric bypass surgery, I feel like it would be too dangerous due to her medical state. She wont listen to me!": "trust", "Well, everyone is entitled to their own life choices. I'm sure she'll be alright.": "trust", "there is nothing i hate more than losing in something": "anger", "Yeah, that's never fun.

": "sadness", "my dog is over at the vet for 4 days and makes the house feel so alone'": "sadness", "Awww, I totally know that feeling. I hate even going on vacation and not being able to bring my dog along. She is family!": "sadness", "yeah i am really looking forward to getting him back": "anticipation", "I can imagine! Is he doing okay?": "fear", "My wife went out of the country for a couple months at the beginning of the summer, dropping her off at the airport was really tough.": "sadness", "It must have been! Have you guys been apart before?": "anger", "Not for more than a few days.  It's been a rough couple months, but it's almost over!": "anticipation", "Ah so you've gone through it a couple of months alrready. How much longer is she going to be away for?": "sadness", "When my wife and I had to move for her to go to school, we had a lot of trouble finding a place to live until my parents were nice enough to cosign on a loan.": "trust", "You must be so thankful!": "trust", "We are.

I used to see him when I was out on my porch and he'd come out for a sniff around or a tinkle. He was so sweet and gentle.": "anger", "Yeah dogs are man's best friend.": "trust", "They sure are. I actually prefer them to some humans I know! Do you have a dog at the moment?": "trust", "Yes I've got one.  She's a stray that showed up to work one day.": "trust", "That's wonderful, that you were able to take her in. Good for you! More people should act like that.": "trust", "She's been a great dog.

I still feel pretty introverted, but since coming to college, I've been forced to socialize more, and it's help me at least \"fake it until I make it.\" I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time, but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?": "sadness", "that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice. ": "sadness", "I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better, most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down, too. Good luck": "fear", "I recently went to ruby falls, an underground cavern with a waterfall. ": "sadness", "That sounds awesome. Have you ever been before?": "joy", "Not that particular one, no.

How about that?": "surprise", "Death by a thousand cuts, I call it! They'll try to make a buck off anything!": "anger", "Very true. They didn't even tell me. That was the last thing I expected! I only just decided to use it again.": "sadness", "Did you try talking to them about it? I can only assume it wouldn't go well but you never know.": "sadness", "Yes. They said that they'd been taken over by another bank and it was the previous one which deducted the money. What rubbish. It just amazes me!": "joy", "Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.": "sadness", "Yes, I have.  One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved.  It was a dark and tough time.  Did that happen to you recently?": "fear", "Yes, my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.": "sadness", "I am soo soo very sorry.  Its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn't have to happen.

Do you?": "joy", "Yeah, he keeps pooping in the floor! He's learning to go outside, but I'm so tired of stepping in doggy poo at 3am!": "disgusted", "It happens. Hope your dog will poop outside soon.": "fear", "I store my chocolate in the fridge to make sure that it stays cold and solid.

I assume that's something he'll grow out of.  How old is he?": "sadness", "I recently had my hip-length hair cut for the first time in years.": "disgusted", "Wow, that took some guts! What made you want to cut it?": "disgusted", "It was kind of scraggly on the ends. It took me some time to get used to the new cut, but it looks much thicker and healthier now.": "sadness", "And just think about how much you're saving on shampoo and conditioner!": "anticipation", "I went around work all day today with a hole in my pants, right on my bottom.": "sadness", "Ahhhh!

It said it would be filled with all sorts of fun and expensive items.": "surprise", "Please tell me it was not full of Oriental Trading Company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes.": "trust", "I would've happily taken that! Instead, it was filled with literal garbage, like a bunch of those empty 99 Bananas bottles and candy wrappers.": "sadness", "Oh man! I feel bad for laughing but \"literal garbage\" is pretty funny. That sucks, can you report them to eBay?": "anger", "I had my final exam for Chemistry today!": "joy", "I'm pretty sure I Aced it! I've been studying for weeks.": "joy", "That's good. I was never good at chemistry": "joy", "It can be rough when I have a problem and need to vent to someone": "sadness", "I understand, anything you need to talk about?": "sadness", "You are sweet because part of the problem is when I realize there really is no one to talk to.

But playing hookey is a fun though": "sadness", "Sometimes I enjoy being alone, but not on a long trip that takes me far away from home.": "sadness", "I know exactly what you mean.  It gets so lonely on the road.  Have you had to go away recently?": "sadness", "This was a while back, but I planned a bicycle trip that went across several states. Although I had a buddy coming with me originally, he ended up bailing and I went alone. I called it quits halfway.": "sadness", "That's still quite a long ride.  Do you do a lot of long distance biking? ": "joy", "I have a beautiful girl friend.

He took some items from the house as I didn't have any money on me": "sadness", "I am glad that you are okay!": "fear", "I like finding little resources or tips that change old habits I've been coping with in what seems like \"1 easy step\"": "joy", "Hahaha, sounds kind of like clickbait": "sadness", "Exactly, I started taping my mouth closed at night, finally woke up before noon, mission accomplished": "joy", "Hahahaha, that's so funny": "sadness", "I started taping my mouth closed before bed, and now I'm no longer tired when I wake up, feels like I am born again": "joy", "That is weird but amazing! Does it work?  If it does, I will get my husband to tape his mouth shut.  He snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back I guess.  Is that true for you?": "anger", "Yeah, it": "sadness", "Do you have any advice on what kind of tape?": "sadness", "I use band aid tape cuz it's okay on the skin": "joy", "Sometimes life just hits you on the head with a good time. Like the other day when I went to the park with my girlfriend.": "sadness", "That sounds like a nice time!": "joy", "It was, but not just because of a romantic walk. When we arrived, there was a festival with games, performances and a fireworks display after sunset! It was incredible!": "surprise", "Wow that worked out perfectly": "joy", "I was trying to study for a final but my neighbors were being really loud, and I had a hard time focusing": "fear", "Did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume?": "sadness", "No, I'm shy and try to avoid confrontation as much as possible": "anger", "Well, I hope you have some really good earphones - or that they quiet down - it's a big egotistical to think that no one around you cares when you are that loud.": "sadness", "I really should have switched banks a long time ago. Nobody over there knows their head from their butt!": "anger", "I know what you mean. Once I had a bank where the teller's literally had butts for heads. It was so distracting trying to talk to them.": "fear", "That sounds truly bizarre! I guess I am still angry because the other day they froze my card, and due to a teller's mistake actually had to take my current card and mail me a new one!": "sadness", "Well it was an upgrade from the bank I had where the tellers were actually robots. I can't believe the cost-cutting measures in place today!": "fear", "I went to a bar I used to go to in college, and I was surprised to see an arcade machine I built with a dear friend of mine!": "sadness", "wow  thats nostalgic!!.

The kicker is, when I got to the front of the line the guy in front of me got the last two tickets!": "surprise", "That sucks. What did you do?": "sadness", "My girlfriend and I were going to a big parade with some friends. As we were leaving, she tripped on the stairs and hurt her ankle.": "sadness", "Oh no, the poor girl. Was she able to walk afterwards?": "sadness", "Unfortunately, it swelled up and she was in no shape to go anywhere. So instead, I stayed with her and watched netflix while we split a pint of icecream.": "sadness", "You're a terrific partner. You guys can do something outdoors next time, right?": "trust", "My cat jumped through the window in the basement and it was the most shocking, but ultimately underwhelming thing": "surprise", "hahaha why was it underwhelming?": "sadness", "I guess because furry things don't really scare me, I was like well that was a waste of a reaction": "fear", "lol how do you feel about spiders?": "fear", "I was getting mad at the weights in the gym to see how much I could lift": "anger", "Why were you getting mad?  Were you not lifting as much as you wanted?": "anger", "No not really, just seeing how much energy I could summon from within": "fear", "I see,  I do that too sometimes.  It helps with motivation": "joy", "There's too many things to think about": "sadness", "You are good at generalizing aren't you?": "joy", "Yeah, what am I getting myself into": "joy", "I have no clue.. really I don't!": "surprise", "I just finally won some money playing scratch lotto tickets.": "joy", "Close to $20,000, I think I'm going to spend it on traveling.": "trust", "Thats sounds like a fun trip or 8": "joy", "I went to a play recently that was unconventional in a really fun way.

What kind of dog is it?": "trust", "It is a german shepherd.

Did you end up getting the job?": "sadness", "I did not get it unfortunately. ": "sadness", "Well, there's always next time. At least you can chalk it up as a learning experience.": "sadness", "One time, I smelled an odd burning smell coming from under the hood of my car.": "fear", "That's strange. What did you discover under there?": "sadness", "Well, when I went to lift the engine cover, I noticed a dead, rotting squirrel on top of the engine block! It was so repulsive.": "disgusted", "Oh my! That is repulsive indeed! I would've taken it home for dinner. Waste not want not!": "joy", "I went to the store, just trying to get some milk and bread, and I got rear ended by a driver.": "sadness", "Oh NO!

Did they stop and check on you?": "fear", "I have been working and prepping a powerful and moving speech.": "joy", "Oh yeah? Is it on par with \"I Have a Dream\"?": "joy", "I can only dream.

I hope you blow Gimli's beard clean off his face and make 20 horns of Gondor sound!": "disgusted", "Someone let me cut in line at the store so I could check out faster.": "anger", "wow that was really nice of them": "surprise", "Yeah, I was in a huge hurry and didn't have much but I really needed to make it to the bank before it closed.": "sadness", "Most people now a days won't do that. Make sure to pay it forward!": "joy", "I thought I bombed my math test but I got a 103 on it.": "sadness", "That's great, man! Did you study hard for it?": "joy", "I reviewed all the homework and the test questions mostly had the same problems on them. I didn't feel like I understood how to do the problems but I remembered the answers.": "joy", "Well, that's all that matters! Just gotta pass those exams!": "sadness", "I just found a photo book of me and my family growing up.": "sadness", "Aw, that's awesome, did it bring back memories?": "sadness", "It was pretty nostalgic , how young we all looked growing up.": "sadness", "Yeah, it's always nice to take a look back and reflect on the early days.": "sadness", "I finally got to see a baseball game live this last week.": "joy", "Nice!

Was she a hoarder? What did you find?": "sadness", "You hit it right on the money.

No harm no foul.": "sadness", "At least you have a happy ending for that story.": "sadness", "Some people are just so generous. Really makes you feel like there is some humanity left out there.": "surprise", "I agree. I think I am one of them, considering I gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday.": "trust", "That's incredible if true, but I have trouble believing you for some reason. I was talking about some stranger who gave my friend 3 free tickets to a rock concert - we had such a blast!": "trust", "That's really great, but I swear it was true! It was a whole 50 cents. Looking back on it, I am kinda sad I did it because now I can't buy that fancy fidget spinner at the supermarket. Hopefully some orphan uses it wisely.": "surprise", "I was so proud of my daughter over the weekend.": "joy", "That's good to hear, what did she do to make you proud?": "joy", "She performed her first solo dance in competition, but she had been in leg braces for the last 2 years.": "surprise", "Oh wow!

I'd like to go lay on a beach, or even just the next town over at this point.": "joy", "I have been extremely diligent in my studies so far, and am participating in two clubs this upcoming year. The future is looking bright!": "joy", "That is awesome.  What are you hoping to do?": "anticipation", "I am an electrical engineering student, and I am interested in quite a few things at this point. I think after this year, I will be able to get a paid internship next summer!": "joy", "That's the dream, to get paid in college.  I wish I could have done that.  Congratulations!": "joy", "I am so tired of hauling garbage to the county dump.": "anger", "Are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick-up?": "disgusted", "The company in my city just quit picking up for any of the residents, so the dump has a line every day.": "anger", "That is insane!

I felt bad for my buddy, but at least he knows he can trust me.": "sadness", "Oh no, it's awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot.": "sadness", "Yeah, his wife got drunk and paid a pass at me. I told her to sober up, and let him know what had happened.": "trust", "Yikes. Well, at least you did the right thing by passing that long, as painful as it might have been. ": "sadness", "I am highly upset that I'm the only one concerned with earning money for our bills": "sadness", "am sorry about that, what are others doing about it": "sadness", "Not much.

At least she doesn't pay them any attention. Or I would flip!": "anger", "aha, thats funny though": "sadness", "Everyone I have ever worked with in a kitchen has either already read \"Kitchen Confidential\", or I have made them read it. We were all devastated when Anthony Bourdain passed away earlier this year.": "joy", "Oh, I haven't read it, but I was also sad to hear he passed": "sadness", "He started from the bottom and worked his way up. He had a passion for people as well as food, and we all still look up to him.": "trust", "Yes, too bad he was struggling with his depression and couldn't seek help": "trust", "My husband and friends planned me a baby shower without me knowing.": "surprise", "Aw, that's so nice of them!

He said he was sorry I'm going!": "sadness", "How long have you been there ?": "joy", "About a year and a half. I really didn't expect him to say that - we don't know each other that well.": "surprise", "Sometimes we affect people that we don't realize.": "anger", "Very true. I do pet his dog when I see them. Perhaps he recognizes a fellow dog-lover!": "sadness", "Ugh...my boss made me stay late yesterday, so I had to work overtime, but I didn't even get paid for it!": "anger", "That doesn't seem fair. How are they getting around not paying you for it?": "anger", "I'm technically salaried, so I don't get paid overtime. It's still really irritating. ": "anger", "It sounds like your boss needs to be more considerate when it comes to his employees.": "anger", "I went to my car one morning and found that some kids in my condo complex had thrown food all over it": "disgusted", "Wow, did you ever get them in trouble?": "sadness", "Sadly, no.

Seems like he has good interviews and they're receptive to him, but they don't really respond or give him an answer. Sorry to hear you guys go through that. Can't imagine how frustrating it is": "anger", "Super frustrating.  It worked out in the end, but I had to bug them a few times to make sure they hadn't abandoned me.": "anger", "Good on you for being aggressive and opportunistic. Maybe they found that to be the motivating factor to give you the job. I hope it's been good so far.": "anticipation", "A friend of mine took early retirement recently and he and his wife are traveling all over the world.": "surprise", "That sounds like so much fun!": "joy", "I know - I wish I could do that.

It'll be great to have her back :)": "sadness", "I'm sure she'll have a lot to tell you about her trip!": "joy", "When I interviewed for the job I have now, they didn't give me a solid answer for like a month after the interview.": "joy", "That's a long time to kind of hang in limbo. I am sorry you had to endure that for a month.": "sadness", "It worked out ok, but I had to keep bugging them to make sure they hadn't given up on me.": "anger", "Well, at least that story had a happy ending. It could have went much worse.": "sadness", "My wife has been out of the country for the last 2 months for school.": "trust", "Aw, I bet you miss her a lot.": "sadness", "I do.  She's getting back soon, but it's been tough being along with the dogs every night.": "sadness", "Well, at least the dogs still have you for company. I'm sure you'll be happy when she gets back though.": "sadness", "When I interviewed for my current job, I felt like it went well but all I could do was wait.": "joy", "A lab technician at a university.": "fear", "Interesting! What kind of things do you do?": "joy", "My parents brought my brother a brand new iPhone. He always gets the newest stuff and I get stuck with nothing.": "trust", "aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you": "sadness", "I have no idea. He's the \"golden child.\" It's super unfair.": "anger", "well after a certain age parent's start to treat children differently lol": "sadness", "My wife has been out of the country for two months, which is really hard when one of us is having a bad day and we can't help the other.": "trust", "when does she return?": "joy", "She gets back in a week, so it's almost over.": "sadness", "my husband opened the door and a huge wasp flew in! I hate insects. they are so nasty": "fear", "Did you go running like crazy!? ": "fear", "heck yes i did!

": "anger", "i hate all the mosquitos that grow during the rain season": "anger", "They are bad now too, they are so annoying": "anger", "yes i hate going out when it is rainny season there is so many of them": "anticipation", "It can be irritating to deal with this time of year": "anger", "Both me and my girlfriend are super scared of spiders, but she made me kill a huge one yesterday. ": "fear", "Come on, the worst that can happen is that it kills you.": "disgusted", "Exactly!!!! Isn't that enough to fear them?!": "fear", "It's certainly a good enough reason to kill them.": "joy", "I'm going skydiving for the first time with some friends!": "trust", "Wow, are you nervous at all": "fear", "A little bit, but I love doing extreme stuff like this.": "joy", "That's exciting. I'd never have the guts to do it so kudos to you.": "surprise", "The othern ight I was having tea outside and forgot my glass outside all night! ": "surprise", "That kind of stinks. Sorry to hear that! Well, at least there are worst things to forget outside.. Maybe this is an easy learning lesson!": "sadness", "It was gross though when I went to go and get it! It was all full of bugs! ": "disgusted", "I didn't even think of that! That's one thing about tea with me, that I've never gotten into it because you get it and it's so hot, so you have to wait forever to drink it. You set it down and then ultimately forget it!": "joy", "On my last visit to my orthopedic surgeon he suggested surgery to fix my hip.": "trust", "Yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results. How do you feel about it? ": "fear", "Nervous. Surgery is a big step and I'm afraid something will go wrong.": "fear", "I understand i would be too but now a days technology is really good just make sure its a reliable hospital! ": "trust", "You're absolutely correct and the hospital's one of the best in the country. Still, I fret about it. I should just get on with it!": "joy", "I'm about to go overseas and i was so overwhelmed with packing and getting ready and my friend came over and helped me to pack ": "joy", "That's a good friend you got there.": "trust", "she is wonderful! She helped me out so many times i don't know what i would do withiut her": "trust", "Never take someone like that for granted. They are so rare.": "trust", "Cell phones are great, but sometimes they can cause situations that are uncomfortable.": "sadness", "What types of situations are you referring to?": "joy", "Usually they just interupt with a ring. But Youtube is on my lock screen and it played out loud while I was inline, and it was not an appropriate topic!": "sadness", "lol, did everyone around you make funny faces?": "joy", "Of course they did, some guy in this video was dropping the f bomb out of no where. I was humiliated,lol.": "sadness", "My dog died today :(": "sadness", "I am so sorry to hear that. Was she able to go surrounded by you guys?": "sadness", "Yes, she had cancer so we knew she was going to pass soon. My daughter won't stop crying.": "sadness", "It's hard to lose a family member like that. You guys should take some time to grieve.": "sadness", "my daughter went on vacation with her friends and the house feels so lonely": "sadness", "Where did they go?": "sadness", "they went to the beach for 1 week": "joy", "I'm moving to a new apartment in a few weeks and can't wait! No more obnoxious upstairs neighbors!": "anger", "That's great!  I've got to deal with loud neighbors too.  Anything specific they do?": "joy", "Stomp around at all times of the day and night, screeching into their cellphones and playing loud video games. What do yours do?": "sadness", "Loud running toddler who pitches fits at random times, day or night.  Sounds like a similar level of noise :P": "anger", "Eww. Yes, it is loud. Who would live in an upstairs apartment with a small child? That's nuts!": "disgusted", "My wife has been out of the country for two months, and is coming back in a week!": "joy", "Oh wow, I bet you can't wait! I remember when I had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband.": "sadness", "It sure is.  It's just been me and the dogs all summer, I've gotten super bored :P": "sadness", "Well, she'll be back soon and you'll have loads of catching up to do. I bet the dogs missed her too!": "anger", "I hope you do too! Applying is a huge step in the right direction!": "joy", "Could you elaborate as to why?": "anger", "I had such a huge spider ran past me in the bathroom.

How long have you been training?": "joy", "for this specific game for about 3 months": "joy", "Wow, that's a lot of dedication!  I believe in you!": "surprise", "After my wife and I moved I went through a while of unemployment.  It was really tough not being able to support us.": "trust", "i can imagine, i have been there and it is the worst just belive in yourself": "sadness", "It's gotten better now, but it could still get even better.

My neighbors weren't here and I could do whatever I wanted without them stomping on my head!": "joy", "That sounds like a relief.": "joy", "It was. I can't even brush my teeth at 8am without one or the other of them thumping around upstairs.": "anger", "It seems like it's a lot of ruckus, I've visited friends who have your situation and I can only imagine. ": "sadness", "That blessed week was so peaceful and calming. Everything felt right in my world. Then they came back!": "joy", "Glad you enjoyed that short period of peace. Maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place.": "sadness", "Getting a new apartment soon. At least the new neighbors will hopefully be at work during the day.": "sadness", "Oh, good. I'm sure it will be an improvement from your current situation.": "joy", "I went to work with my pants inside out, and I didn't notice until my secretary pointed it out.": "sadness", "Omg i would have been so embarrassed! :O ": "sadness", "It was very embarrassing!

Odd how being alone can make you paranoid.": "trust", "i cant wait to see my dog back home it has been 2 years since i see him": "joy", "I would go mad, were you away at college or in the service?": "anger", "college, but i will be seeing him very soon i think": "joy", "That is great, I am sure he misses you and will be so happy to see you. He will smell you coming and know your there even before you get in the door.": "joy", "So my youngest went to his first day of kindergarten today.  So proud of him.  Silly I know.": "joy", "That's not silly at all! I'm sure he'll love it.": "sadness", "I hope so should be home really soon.  Can't wait to hear all about it.

Weddings can be stressful": "trust", "i hate when my neighboors dog poops on my yard and she does nothing, i dont care if he poops if she picks it up": "anger", "Maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard?": "anger", "hahaha i mean he does not do it often but it is not a bad idea": "anger", "Its the only way to get them to learn": "sadness", "After studying and preaching for a few years, my husband was ordained to be a minister.": "joy", "That's wonderful, it's always good when hard work pays off like that!": "joy", "Yes it is and he is so devoted to God and living for Him. I was so happy for him.": "trust", "I bet so that sounds nice": "joy", "Thank you.": "sadness", "This morning, my dog knocked down a while box of cereal and it spilled everywhere.": "anger", "Oh wow, that sounds like it was a big mess.": "disgusted", "Yes, and to make it worse, when I tried to clean it, she tried to eat, so she almost knocked me over too. I was not happy.": "anger", "I hope she didn't eat too much of it, it might make her sick.": "disgusted", "No, she only ate a little bit. I cleaned it up pretty quickly.": "surprise", "There was a new resturaunt that opened up around the corner and everyone was raving about it ": "disgusted", "Oh yeah? Did you go give it a try?": "fear", "I did! It was terrible! I was so upset! It was expensive, small, and bland! ": "sadness", "That's a shame. I hate it when a place doesn't live up to the hype.": "sadness", "In my last job most of my co-workers had different beliefs to me. It was a little awkward at times.": "sadness", "That can be a bit uncomfortable for sure. Did you try and avoid conversations": "fear", "If things got a bit much I'd excuse myself and go elsewhere. I didn't want to get into an argument, but wasn't going to compromise my own beliefs by lying.": "sadness", "If it gets to be too much be sure to walk away.": "fear", "I became quite good at that - the great vanishing employee, lol. I'm all for earnest discussion, but not at work!": "joy", "My husband had to repair something and we bought a ton of lumber. He was able to carry so much at once! ": "trust", "He must be really strong!": "trust", "He is! I was so shocked but super attracted to him too! ": "surprise", "Sure,  I strong men is very attractive! You must be proud of him!": "joy", "i was really sad when my dog died last year": "sadness", "That is hard thing to go through. I hope you are feeling better about it now.": "sadness", "yeah i have been over it for sometime now but it is till hard to talk about": "sadness", "I bet. Losing a pet is much like losing a loved one. It gets better but still hurts sometime.": "sadness", "A good friend was supposed to visit me this Summer, but he got a job and had to cancel.": "sadness", "Aw, that sucks. But at least he got a job, right?": "sadness", "Yeah, and it's one he really wanted and enjoys. I'm really happy for him, but would have really liked to see him.": "joy", "Well, hopefully he can schedule another time to come visit you.": "sadness", "I hope so. We always have such a good time and like a lot of the same things. Oh well, some other time.": "joy", "My husband's grandmother and I were very close. We hung out and talked everyday. One Friday, we went to breakfast and she told me that her and her husband were going on vacation the next day. She was so excited. The next morning I called her after they had left and told her to be safe, have fun, and that I loved her. She told me she loved me too. The morning after that phone call, we found out that she had a heart attack and died.  ": "sadness", "Oh my. That is very unfortunate.": "sadness", "Yes, it hit our whole family very hard. That was in 2013, and sometimes I still pick up the phone to call her and tell her something.": "sadness", "I know that feeling. Im sure she is looking down on you all.": "sadness", "My cat went missing 3 days ago. I found her. ": "sadness", "That must have been a little bit of a roller coaster. That's kind of why I'm not wild about cats, is because they're so independent, and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you. But I guess that suits some people.": "sadness", "I found her on the side of the street with her guts hanging in the gutter. I was so upset and sad": "disgusted", "Oh man.. so that was REALLY a roller coaster then. I'm so sorry.. I hope you're not overwhelming yourself with guilt about it. It sounds like something you could not have any control over.": "sadness", "I love to play golf, but injured my hip a while back. I really want to play again.": "sadness", "My nephew is getting into golf! It seems like a cool enough sport, albeit a little expensive. I hope you're able to get back to playing again. I've taken up running and swimming, and it's interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day.": "joy", "It sure is! Good on your nephew - it's a great sport. And good for you, too. It's all too easy just to sit back. I have to force myself to do physical therapy so I can walk again!": "joy", "Well, often people just give up and relegate themselves to just sitting in a chair and watching TV. Even if you have to force yourself, at least you are forcing yourself. At some point hopefully you will see progress and feel it getting easier. Once that happens, motivation starts to become real easy to get.": "anger", "Just the thought of getting back on the golf course is enough to get me off the couch, lol.": "anger", "Skydiving is an exillirating and scary experience!": "fear", "I've never been skydiving myself. I hear that it's a great experience, but I'm not sure if I have the bravery for it.": "trust", "I did not for many years, but my brother convinced me to tandem with him to celebrate our mothers remission.": "trust", "Oh wow. Is it something that you would do again?": "sadness", "I think when my children are grown that I might, I would need to feel secure with the abilities of those in charge. You are putting your life in their hands.": "trust", "I bought a new tv. The colors are so vibrant and it is so sharp!": "joy", "Sounds like fund, you must be excited!": "joy", "I am, I have been watching all my favorite movies. ": "sadness", "I think I will need to do that, my TV is an oldy.  I am sure you will have a great time.": "joy", "I am, I think my wife is getting tired of all the time I am spending watching movies. ": "joy", "I woke up needing to use the bathroom at midnight. As soon as I sit down a giant bug flew into my face! ": "anger", "That sounds horrible. I would not have been able to sleep after that.": "disgusted", "I screamed so loud that I woke up my husband and he though we were being burgled! ": "fear", "How terrifying. I hope you were able to find and kill it.": "fear", "I have this very serious interview tomorrow and I'm so nervous. I know what to say but i'm scared i will forget everything": "fear", "Well, it's okay to be a bit nervous. Interviewers will understand that. You only have to halfway reign in it in and you'll hit that happy medium that's good for a workplace interview. Where are you applying to?": "fear", "a government position. Can't really say much. :) but I really hope i will get this job, they pay really good money": "anticipation", "I bet you have a good shot at it! Good luck": "joy", "I had a dream the other night about my friends from high school. It brought back all kinds of memories from my teen years and thinking back made me smile.": "sadness", "Did you tell anyone about the dream?": "sadness", "I told my husband. The dream made me miss my best friend from high school.": "sadness", "You should call your best friend on the telephone!": "sadness", "I actually sent her a message through facebook.": "sadness", "That is sure to make you feel the nostalgic?": "sadness", "I guess that's a good word for it. ": "joy", "I came home from work today and my wife had a new puppy waiting for me.": "joy", "oh that sounds like fun": "joy", "Yeah, he is such a cutie. I have been playing with my new pup the rest of the day. ": "anger", "sounds like a wonderful day!": "joy", "It is, a day I will always remember. I named him spot, because he has a funny looking spot on his back. ": "sadness", "I saved up the money to buy a certain dress that I had been wanting for a while. When I finally got the money saved, it was sold out everywhere, except Ebay. The problem was, the price was doubled.": "sadness", "Oh My!! What are you going to do? I would buy it anyway. ": "joy", "I may buy it still, but I have to save up more money now.": "sadness", "Well thats unfortunate. Hopefully you will be able to buy it soon. ": "sadness", "I hope so. I as so exited to be able to get it.": "joy", "I bought a load of German chocolate bars in Aldi. I then ate too many of them. I shouldn't have done that - no self-control!": "sadness", "It happens to the best of us. It would be great if they did not make us gain weight.": "sadness", "It was sheer greed, I'm afraid. I know everyone has their moments, but I really shouldn't have done that.": "fear", "Well you have to live a little every now and then. I'm sure it was worth it, haha.": "sadness", "It certainly was - German chocolate is delicious!": "joy", "my son is sick, he got this hand foot and mouth desease, nothing serious but he has a fever": "trust", "Oh no, poor baby": "sadness", "i know, i got some motrin, funny movies and lots of cuddles.i hope he will feel better tomorrow": "joy", "Yes cuddles will help": "trust", "i used to be a member of a cool dance crew. we had so much fun together. we used to battle other teams and win local competitions": "sadness", "That sounds really fun. Can you still remember some of the routines?": "sadness", "honestly, no, it's been 8 years haha loooong time ago! I wish i could hang out with all those people again": "sadness", "Yea that is a long time. You should reach out to some and see if they are on social media.": "sadness", "I'm getting really psyched about the upcoming Ryder Cup golf tournament. I've been watching it since I was a kid.": "joy", "I'm fascinated by how people can watch golf, I always found it really boring, but if you enjoy it then great!": "surprise", "I've been around the game all my life and just love both playing and watching. I'd imagine that, if you don't play, it would be pretty boring!": "joy", "Oh that totally changes things I guess, makes sense.": "anger", "I think it's the format of this tournament that gets me addicted. It's not like regular tournaments, in that teams are playing against each other.": "anticipation", "Last Christmas Eve, after a family event, I found my ten year old daughter crying in her room. At the event she had overheard someone calling her daddy fat and making fun of him, and it had hurt her feelings.": "sadness", "Aw that's terrible, at least you were able to comfort her?": "sadness", "Yes, I was able to make her feel better, and her daddy made her laugh. But my mama bear side came out, and I was ready to confront some people.": "joy", "I'm sure you were! Those people deserved some confrontation for sure.": "sadness", "Yes, they did.": "sadness", "I was cleaning up my garden bed when I found a bunch of bones in it! ": "fear", "Oh my god! what did you do? did you tell anyone?": "sadness", "I called the cops! Turns out that it's bird bones! My cat has been killing bird after bird and leaving it in my garden! ": "trust", "LOLOLOL the cops probably had a good laugh about that.": "sadness", "I get really mad when I hear about people abusing animals. What revolting individuals!": "anger", "Me too!!! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures. ": "anger", "They're filthy, ignorant bullies. I would sentence them to life in prison, without parole!!!": "disgusted", "Really!! I would go even further and give them the electric chair. I have no tolerance for those types of people. ": "anger", "More laws need to be passed so they can be prosecuted. So many states have nothing on the statute books.": "fear", "Last night I heard a weird noise outside. It really scared my wife and I. ": "fear", "Oh, I hate it when that happens. Did you find out what it was?": "fear", "It ended up just being a raccoon rummaging through our trash. But at the time we thought it was someone trying to break in. ": "fear", "I'm glad it wasn't something dangerous. That would be a terrifying experience.": "fear", "It would be, I worry for the safety of my family. ": "fear", "My friend borrowed quite a lot of money from me. I really do believe he'll repay me.": "sadness", "You do? thats good, friends can be terrible people to lend too.": "trust", "They can, but he was in a real bind and I was able to do so. I know he's grateful for the loan, so I reckon I'll be ok there.": "trust", "I bet he pays you in full.": "joy", "Even part would be ok. He needs to get a bunch of savings together so he doesn't find himself in that situation again.": "sadness", "My husband asked me to put on a blindfold the other night and he led me outside! I was so scared at first ": "fear", "I bet that was scary. Did he surprise you with something?": "surprise", "He did! He had set up a dinner table in a clearing in our yard right when the sun was setting. Dinner was ready and waiting and warm too! ": "surprise", "Ahhh. How nice. You are lucky to have such a thoughtful husband. ": "trust", "Ever seen a drone fly at night? It's far creepier than you might imagine at first, especially if it's in the early morning, like 3am or something.": "fear", "Does it look like a space ship?": "trust", "Well at night it's kind of hard to tell that it looks like anything. All you can see is just the blinking locator lights on it, and all you can hear is the buzzing of the props. But who knows what could be attached to the drone? Cameras? Some kind of gas?": "fear", "I have never seen a drone flying around here. Even in the day time": "fear", "i love my friend, she is pretty funny and cool but goodness gracious she is so nosy it's annoying sometimes": "trust", "What does she do?": "joy", "like we were hanging out yesterday and my hysband called and i walked to a different room to talk to him and when i came back she started asking me questions about what he said and stuff likethat": "sadness", "Wow, I would just tell her its private. Sounds annoying": "anger", "It is so difficult to have a pet pass away, I really miss him.": "sadness", "Aw I understand that, I have gone through that myself and it's very hard. When did this happen? ": "sadness", "Over the summer, he started acting strange so we took him in for testing.": "joy", "Oh no I'm very sorry. What kind of pet? ": "sadness", "A border collie, he was a great doggie.": "sadness", "My daughter called and said my grandson had to have a chest xray because he was having trouble breathing. I was so worried I didn't know what to do with myself.": "trust", "Oh no, have you been able to calm yourself down?": "sadness", "She called several hours later to let me know everything was ok. I worry even more because they live so far away.": "sadness", "I can understand that, I think I would be a mess too.": "fear", "I am actually furious. I'm writing this from a hotel. A truck full of rotten salmon smashed through the wall of my bedroom yesterday. Place smells awful.": "anger", "That does not sound plpeasant at all, maybe they should relocate those who are staying there.": "anger", "I relocated myself to a hotel to stay there until it gets repaired. Luckily my insurance is paying for my stay, but I'll be suing the hell out of the trucking company.": "trust", "Hopefully no one was injured at all from the accident?": "fear", "I am so glad that I decided to pack a kit for my car in case of bad winter weather.": "joy", "I bet you are, that's some pretty good foresight right there! Did you have to use it this past winter?": "sadness", "I did, two days after packing it we had a blizzard and my tire went flat out in the middle of it. I would have been very unhappy had I not packed it.": "joy", "How satisfying must it be to have something like that ready to go in case of emergency, and then to actually get to use it? I'm pretty jealous, and proud in a vicarious kind of way.": "joy", "I was, and happy to have water, granola bars, and an extra cell phone charger!": "joy", "I have a ton of work to complete to earn my degree this year.": "joy", "Well good luck with that!": "joy", "Thank you, I have been compiling  data for 5 years, my brain is totally absorbed by it.": "sadness", "What are you studying?": "joy", "Criminal and social justice.": "sadness", "I just froze when It was my turn to get on the tycoon rollar coaster at disney world.": "fear", "Do roller coasters scare you": "fear", "I think it was just the thought of being so high up.": "sadness", "I used to be afriad of heights too": "fear", "I had to stay home and work, while all my friends go to denver and snowboard.": "anger", "That's a bummer. Maybe next time you can join them.": "sadness", "Hopefully, but the worst part is there is nothing to do on the weekend with everyone gone.": "sadness", "Sound like a Netflix weekend then. Hope you got a lot of work done.": "joy", "In some ways, losing a pet dog is even worse than losing a relative. They're so innocent, they're so helpless. They don't deserve to have to die or suffer ever.": "sadness", "Goodness, you're right about that. Plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you.": "trust", "Exactly, and they never demand anything from you. When my golden retriever Louie died a few weeks ago, I honestly thought I would die too.": "sadness", "I'm so very sorry for your loss, I can only imagine that pain. I had to put my girl down 3 years ago and I promise that it does get easier.": "sadness", "Thank you, that's good to hear. I find it pretty difficult to continue on most days...but I suppose it's starting to get easier.": "sadness", "A week before my cruise this summer, I was counting down the days with bated breath. I thought I would actually DIE before I got to go on it.": "joy", "It's the worst waiting for vacations! You want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during. Never works out that way, unfortunately.": "anger", "Yes! Completely the opposite of what you want. The universe can be funny like that. But I had an absolute blast!": "sadness", "That's great! I'm glad you had a good time. I've never been on a cruise before but it sounds like I need to try one out!": "joy", "When my daughter was born doctors said she wouldn't ever go to school and basically be mentally handicapped. ": "trust", "And how is she doing now": "sadness", "She is a normal A-B student and just started 8th grade": "joy", "That is awesome.  Sometimes a second opinion is all you need": "joy", "I finally had a day of, but the weather was terrible and rainy and cold.": "joy", "aww that's too bad.  I hope you got some solid netflix in at least!": "disgusted", "I was hoping to get a chance to play outside and get some sun.": "anticipation", "bummer.  Well I hope you get a chance to do that soon!": "sadness", "I just got back from a latenight showing of the horror movie insidious": "anger", "Oh that sounds fun!": "joy", "Not really I  almost had an accident at some of the startling points.": "fear", "That isn't good at all, glad you didn't have an accident. ": "sadness", "I have been looking around at different car insurance quotes": "anger", "Did you find any good companies.": "anger", "a couple but it amazes me how expensive insurance is": "joy", "Did you have alot of accidents that can jack your rates up.": "anger", "I just ate a whole cake by myself, I feel sick!": "sadness", "It's okay! Try to rest on the couch and that might help!": "anger", "Thank you, being on a diet is hard with sweets in the house. ": "sadness", "I know that feeling all too well. But don't get down on it, just try better tomorrow.": "sadness", "The other night I had a panic attack out the blue ": "fear", "That must have been scary.  Is that the first time it has happened to you?": "fear", "Sadly no, I get them maybe once a year. The worst part was that I had nothing to be stressed about. ": "sadness", "Are you able to do anything to prevent them?": "anger", "I left the front door unlocked this morning and our dog got out. I can't believe I would be so careless.": "sadness", "I'm sure that he will turn up soon. I really hope that you find him.": "sadness", "We have been driving around all evening looking for him. He really is my best friend.": "trust", "Maybe check your local animal shelters? Sometimes they are taken there by people who find them. ": "sadness", "We will have to go there next, hopefully he is chilling there. ": "joy", "I felt completely discarded after my last ex ghosted me. We'd been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was fine. Then...nothing.": "sadness", "Aww, I'm sorry to hear that.  Was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms?": "sadness", "That's just it. We didn't really \"break up\" in the traditional sense. She just sort of stopped talking to me and I eventually texted her and said okay, thanks for the memories. But it was rough.": "sadness", "That's really odd.  I wonder why they didn't have the courtesy to let you know that they'd lost interest or whatever the case may be.  To just cut off contact seems a little rude.": "anger", "Today I was getting coffee and the person in front of me paid for my drink. I couldn't believe people would be so nice, I was so thankful because money has been tight.": "trust", "How thoughtful.  Now you have to pay it forward, as the saying goes.": "trust", "I will, you never know when someone else is in need! ": "sadness", "Kindness is infectious.": "anger", "It is, I have been so blessed in my life! ": "trust", "My husband started college this week!": "joy", "How exciting, is he a non-traditional student?": "joy", "Yes, he is still active duty army but getting out in November. I am so proud of him furthering his education!": "joy", "That is really good, speaking from experience, all military men and women should get a degree.": "joy", "I am a really picky eater, and now my favorite restaraunt is ruined for me.": "anger", "Why? What happened? I hope you didn't get food posioning.": "sadness", "No poisoning, but my burger had a long hair in it, so I couldn't eat it.": "disgusted", "Oh gosh, that is gross! Maybe tell the manager so he can make it right, and make sure his staff is doing things to health codes!": "disgusted", "So gross, that is certain.": "disgusted", "I got a cup of coffee the other day and on my way back to my desk I tripped on thin air": "sadness", "Oh no! I hope you did not burn yourself.": "sadness", "I thankfully didn't burn myself bad but I spilled it all over myself! I was so shy afterwards ": "sadness", "Hopefully you were wearing dark clothing, coffee on light colors stinks!": "anger", "Watching scary movies lately has me paranoid, I was really frightened the other night.": "fear", "I went for a drink downstairs, and the back door was wide open. I didn't sleep a wink and kept my phone and a big knife with me the rest of the night,lol.": "fear", "Oh man! I would have been so scared! ": "fear", "I really was, and I'm supposed to be the grown up, but I got my daughter to lie next to me.": "sadness", "My neighbors dog are barking so loud and my daughter is asleep!": "anger", "Ugh that's so annoying. What are they even barking at?": "anger", "People walking on the bike trail behind our house. It's a daily thing, it gets so annoying! ": "anger", "Yeah, that would drive me crazy. Sounds like the neighbor needs to control their dogs.": "disgusted", "I just got done eating an entire pizza by myself.": "sadness", "I do that all the time, no big deal.": "sadness", "I feel so full and fat and happy. I can't wait to do it again.": "joy", "What kind of pizza did you eat?": "joy", "When I got my first paycheck with a bonus, I knew I didn't need to worry anymore about my expenses. It was quite the feeling!": "joy", "That is such a relief, it is so nice to have money saved up in the bank. ": "trust", "Yes exactly! I was able to finally start saving for retirement. I'd been procrastinating somewhat, so it really was a relief, like you said.": "joy", "Oh yeah, retirement will come before you know it, it is good to be prepared! ": "joy", "Tomorrow I start my new job teaching kids. I really hope it goes well!": "joy", "Oh wow, now that really is exciting, congratulations! Did you get the grade level and subject you wanted?": "joy", "I am teaching at a small private school, so I will be teaching all the subjects for 3rd grade. I am pretty excited, just nervous. ": "joy", "Teaching little humans will be such a joy. I really hope you enjoy it!": "joy", "It really is, you are molding their future! ": "disgusted", "I just lost my dog. My ex got him in the divorce": "sadness", "That sucks, will she not let you see the dog at all?": "sadness", "No we are not on speaking terms, It's pretty unfair, thankfully we didn't have a kid together.": "anger", "Yes, that is probably a positive.": "sadness", "Getting a new debit card takes so long and really is a hassle.": "trust", "Yeah it really does. It's even worse to try and close those accounts!": "sadness", "They don't want to. I lost mine or it was stolen. But all my autopay bills are at a standstill and the companies are not happy about it.": "anger", "Man that sounds really stressful...": "fear", "It is, to say the least. But at leaast it will be over at some point.": "sadness", "My sister got a promotion at work last week!": "joy", "oh that is awesome. what does she do?": "joy", "She is an accountant for a college in Alaska. She's been working their for years so I'm glad they saw her dedication :)": "joy", "that is great. my sister is an account too. she's also the office manager.": "surprise", "My friend wrote a creative writing piece that I helped edit, and it won her a scholarship. I was so proud, like a dad, even though we're roughly the same age.": "surprise", "Congrats to your friend! That is an amazing accomplishment.": "joy", "Yeah it was! I joke with her that I should get a portion of the money since I told her she had a really good piece and that she should submit it. She wasn't originally going to.": "sadness", "I would be proud of her too! Hopefully her success continues. You sound like a good friend!": "trust", "My eldest son is off and is starting his first year in college.  Im so nervous for him!": "fear", "don't be. i'm sure you raised him right. he will be starting his new adventure": "joy", "I think it's more stressful for me than it is for him!  I just want the best for him, just not used to not being there with him.": "trust", "i'm sure he's cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck. it will be fine.": "joy", "Thanks!  I m sure it will be to just have to get over it and let him grow up.  Gotta lose the control freak in me at some point right?": "sadness", "it will be find. have a little fiath in him and you will see": "fear", "Cant wait to see what he can do,  Its exciting too!  ": "anticipation", "it's very exciting. i wish you both all the best.": "joy", "I have trouble remembering a time I was more incredibly overwhelmed with excitement than when I got the Nintendo 64 for Christmas all those years ago.": "sadness", "I remember that console, that's old school.": "sadness", "It sure is now, but back then it was the cream of the crop. You can bet that I stayed up a few hours past my bedtime to play it that evening.": "sadness", "Those were the good old days!": "sadness", "I need a B average to stay in my major and I'm struggling in a course.": "joy", "are you able to get some tutoring or find a study buddy?": "joy", "I found a study group, I didn't flunk the class. But I made an 84 on my physics test and need an 86.": "sadness", "thats good.. well you are on your way up!": "joy", "Hopefully, I don't even understand how others get all A's.": "joy", "I came home from work today and my husband had dinner already made! ": "surprise", "Thats awesome, can we trade?": "joy", "Haha my husband plays video games as well, but we limited it to after my daughter goes to bed only.": "trust", "That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready, unlike mine": "surprise", "Let me tell you something. Always check before you go grocery shopping to see if you need to pick up coffee filters. Few things worse than having to go without your morning coffee because you forgot!": "anger", "that is very true": "sadness", "Not only did I have a rough morning because of it, but I had to deal with the caffeine withdrawal headache all day at work. What a disaster.": "sadness", "hopefully its better tomorrow!": "sadness", "4": "joy", "Hmm, that's interesting tell me more about what that number means to you.": "sadness", "Four years old is the age a child needs to be for a bearded dragon, they carry something in their nails/claws.": "disgusted", "Really, my friend had a tarantula as a pet when she was five, scared the poop out of me": "fear", "My son wanted one of those once, but when we got to the pet store he refused to hold one,lol.": "sadness", "I got canned from my job and I'm feeling pretty good these days because I have more work than I can handle without needing to go to an office everyday": "joy", "Are you really able to work from home? Finding a gig is so difficult, I'm glad that it is working for you.": "joy", "Yeah it's still a work in progress but I'm young and basically living on peanuts, good thing I'm not allergic": "disgusted", "I was laying in bed last night when I realized just how happy I am": "joy", "That is fantastic. Any good new lately?": "joy", "Nope! I just realized how happy and content I am with my life! ": "joy", "That is an amazing feeling. ": "joy", "I had such a bad cold last week, I was coughing up a lot of nasty stuff into cups just so that it wouldn't hurt when I swallowed.": "disgusted", "did you go to the doctor": "fear", "No, thankfully my symptoms weren't anything that couldn't be managed with a stiff mimosa or seven. But still, I had to throw those cups out. Yuck.": "disgusted", "yuk for sure": "disgusted", "No matter how many times I told her that I didn't do it, my roommate insisted that I ate her ice cream last night! Unbelievable!": "anger", "Well, did you eat her ice cream?": "sadness", "I certainly would have liked to, but I'm lactose intolerant! If I had eaten it, I would have been so miserable that there's no way she would've mistaken it.": "trust", "I wonder who actually ate it then.": "surprise", "She probably did, during one of those nights when she stumbles into the apartment at 3am, drunk, with some random guy she brought home from the club.": "sadness", "So are you saying it could be the guy?": "anger", "Either he ate it, or she did and she just doesn't remember doing it. All I know is that I didn't do it, and I'm about to hulk out!": "sadness", "I am so not ready for this baby. The wife is due next week, and I'm really uncertain that I'm gonna be a good dad or that we'll have enough to provide for her.": "fear", "You will be fine. Its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it.": "sadness", "I hope you're right. I've read lots of parenting books, and I've been seeing my therapist regularly. There's just so much that I'm still worried about.": "fear", "Then it sounds like you are already ahead of most new fathers. ": "joy", "I was walking and say a cat in front of me wagging its tail on the sidewalk and thought it was awesome": "sadness", "That would be pretty cool to see, but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they're annoyed or angry! It didn't attack you, did it?": "anger", "I attacked it with some pets, it was an outside cat which don't get angry too much I'm guessing": "sadness", "Ahh, okay. Yeah I don't know. It might have also been scared or feeling like it had to protect it's turf. But still, that's neat to see and not an everyday thing!": "fear", "I'm taking my midterm exam this week, and I really want to do well on it. I've studied a lot, and taken the practice test 5 times. I'm still pretty anxious though!": "fear", "Nice, I guess the only times I was nervous to take a test was when I wasn't prepared, but there's only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever": "joy", "That's true. I probably have it down pat at this point. It's just it's my first graduate course, and I want to ace my entire graduate degree with a 4.0 GPA. This is my first major major grade.": "joy", "Wow! You must have like every technique in your toolbox to go for that goal": "joy", "I was unpacking the other day and realized that my ex-girlfriend didn't get all of her stuff out of my place after we split up and before I moved. Really made me miss her, seeing all that stuff.": "sadness", "i bet it does bud, I know the feeling. So how do you deal with it": "joy", "Well, I spent some time remembering the good times. Then I reminded myself that we broke up for a reason, and we'd moved on. Had to process all the way through it, you know?": "sadness", "yes i know, good memories do help. every relation is a new chapter in the book called our life.": "sadness", "Polie officers should still be required to drive safely even when responding to a call.": "anger", "sometimes they cant avoid it ": "anger", "I threw the car in reverse and hauled my butt backwards!": "sadness", "I understand, but coming at me head on, on a two lane highway, while I'm on a bridge with nowhere to go is not cool.": "anger", "I cant imagine how scared you must have been.": "fear", "Uh oh, did he destroy something? Sounds as though he misbehaved a bit.": "sadness", "Not sure. You must be very confused. Did you crash?": "sadness", "2": "sadness", "I saw a scorpion in my house yesterday and still haven't found it!": "fear", "Oh god. Was it big?": "fear", "Yes, im scared to sleep! It ran under couch last time I saw it.": "fear", "Well, maybe look at its lifespan? Maybe it'll die if you end up not finding it.": "sadness", "I am constantly amazed by my sister's art skills. I'm not sure where she got them...my brother and I can't draw to save our lives.": "surprise", "what does she draw": "sadness", "Mostly anime characters and various portraits. She's still quite young, so she has a way to go, but if you asked me to draw anything similar to what she can when I was her age? Forget about it.": "sadness", "thats awesome": "joy", "I used to worry that I would never have a long term friend who would be there to listen to me if I had problems, but my best friend Kayla has proved otherwise. ": "joy", "Kayla sounds wonderful! How long have you guys been friends?": "joy", "I'll have known her for 7 years next year. She really is wonderful. I've gone through a lot of tough stuff in my life, and she's always been supportive.": "trust", "Finding someone like that is rare. Take good care of that one!": "surprise", "I have some bad news, unfortunately. Well, bad for me. I was diagnosed with lung cancer.": "sadness", "I am sorry to hear that. How far along is it?": "sadness", "It's stage two. I think I'll be able to beat it because I'm otherwise in great health, and it hasn't metastasized or anything. I just wasn't expecting to have to deal with this incredibly difficult time ahead of me.": "joy", "Keep a positive attitude. I will be thinking of you!": "anticipation", "Thank you so much for being supportive. :)": "trust", "I heard gunshots outside my house the other day in the middle of the night. I think it was 2 or 3 in the morning.": "fear", "Did you find out what happened?": "sadness", "Not a chance! I was too scared to go out, and I didn't want to peek my head out to talk to the police or anything when they showed up. I honestly thought someone might have barged into my house and started trying to shoot me.": "fear", "Man. That must've been really nerve wrecking. Did you get any sleep?": "fear", "Only the couple of hours before the gunshots woke me up. After that, no way jose.": "fear", "I really didn't know what to expect while my dad was having neck surgery last weekend.": "fear", "did it turn out ok ?": "fear", "Seems to have, yeah. He has a lot less neck pain now than he has this past year, but that's happened during his previous neck surgeries as well.": "anticipation", "hopes he continues to get better": "trust", "Yes, hopefully he does, because this was one of the last neck surgeries they were willing to do before fusing his neck completely, not allowing him to be able to turn his head anymore.": "sadness", "I got some pretty horrible news recently. I've been diagnosed HIV positive. I'm just...lost...": "sadness", "I'm so sorry!  Don't lose hope though. I know some science based nutrition that helps you overcome and kill it going high nutrition plant based vegan.  Look up Dr. Joel Furhman.  It'll save you from all the meds that hurt your body.": "sadness", "I might look into that, thank you for being supportive. I know it's nowhere near a death sentence anymore, it's just there are so many questions. Can I have kids, is a big one.": "fear", "I know it must be overwhelming you but coming from someone that is fighting chronic epstein barr virus and Lupus, it will change your life.  Check out HIV and going vegan on youtube and thebody,com and so many other resources.  You might be able to reverse it and it wouldn't even be a concern for having kids.  You take care and have hope!": "sadness", "Playing old video games reminds of the summers where my friends and I would hang out endlessly": "sadness", "Sounds like you're feeling nostalgic.  What games were you plaing?": "sadness", "Super smash bros is a classic, never gets old, but yeah you're right": "joy", "I've never played it but its supposed to havea bunch of old game characters in it": "sadness", "I had a job interview recently": "joy", "Oh, how did it go?": "sadness", "Not well. I didn't really feel prepared for it.": "joy", "I'm sorry, I am sure you will be ready next time.": "joy", "Speaking of co-workers, one of my colleagues just found the cure for type 2 diabetes, and I honestly couldn't be more annoyed about it.": "sadness", "Wait, why would you be annoyed by that? That's amazing!": "joy", "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amazing and all, but it was supposed to be MY discovery. I wanted that Nobel Prize and the trip to Stockholm. Now I don't think my dad will ever think I've accomplished anything.": "joy", "I think you need to look at the bigger picture, though. Someone cured a disease that has caused so much suffering for so many people. Though I suppose to can be both excited for the discovery and jealous at the same time. The two aren't mutually exclusive.": "sadness", "I went to a movie alone recently because none of my friends wanted to go with me": "sadness", "What movie did you see": "sadness", "Jurassic World. It was okay.": "sadness", "Yeah I have heard bad things to be honest": "sadness", "I just bought iced coffee yesterday and my brother drank the rest of it without asking me.": "anger", "Wow. Does he usually do stuff like that?": "surprise", "Yeah, he will eat or drink whatever he finds in the fridge. ": "disgusted", "Damn well, he's gonna have to learn some boundaries with that.": "sadness", "I thought it was unfair how YouTube banned Alex Jones": "sadness", "It is indeed unfair, they shouldn't have done that": "anger", "I think people are just getting riled up for the midterms": "anticipation", "you are right. But hey people just do what they want to!!": "anger", "I was playing hide n seek when I was a kid and I had to use the restroom, but then I realized after a couple minutes that there was someone behind the shower curtain": "sadness", "I bet that was awkward": "sadness", "Yeah, nobody said anything": "sadness", "I guess that happens sometimes, did you finish the game": "sadness", "My girlfriend has been cheating on me with another woman!": "trust", "That is terrible and a little odd!": "anger", "Yeah, tell me about it! I trusted her to only cheat on me with other men, but I just don't know how I can deal with this betrayal!!!": "sadness", "Wait, you were ok with her cheating?": "sadness", "Not like this! She assured me that she wasn't that type of girl, and I was stupid enough to believe her.": "trust", "I knew that I needed to support my Uncle Bill when he told me he wanted to flee to Canada to escape military duty. Family always comes first.": "joy", "Yes indeed! what did you do?": "joy", "I helped him pack the essentials in his wood-paneled station wagon and filled his gas tank for him. It was the least I could do.": "joy", "You did great! Family comes first. And you gave him your support!": "joy", "Speaking of kids in school, I just found out my son got a B in his world history class at the end of the previous school year. I can't believe it.": "joy", "That's great!!  History is so important I think and so few kids really grasp it well.  Congrats to him for a job well done!": "joy", "No no, see, it was the first grade below an A that he's ever made. I honestly thought I had the next Einstein on my hands. Now I guess I'll have to settle for...above average, I guess. :(": "sadness", "Oh, I see what you are saying!  Did he get upset about it?  And you never know, he could turn it around next year and blow you away!": "anger", "He seemed fine about it, which is weird because he's always been so proud to bring home straight As. I'm really hoping he does turn it around next year. I also hope he's not on drugs or something. I suppose we'll see.": "anticipation", "So I have some amazing news. I recently discovered that my dog can speak to me! Isn't that incredible?": "sadness", "Wow, is that true? That's pretty amazing! I'd say science should know about your dog.": "joy", "I'd say you're certainly right about that! He's got the best Cockney accent though, and won't shut up about philosophy. It's all he wants to talk about! Like okay, we get it, you're suuuuper into Immanuel Kant, cool.": "anger", "Wow, that surely is incredible! Even the accent too? And intelligent! The full package!": "joy", "I mean, let's be honest. I'm the Major League Eating world champion. When I saw that my next closest competition had only ever maxed 40 hot dogs, I knew I had that thing in the bag.": "surprise", "Dang, that's a lot of dogs. Cleaned out the pound, you did. But that doesn't hold a candle to the 100 I ate yesterday.": "sadness", "Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well. I would relish the opportunity to eat alongside you one day at the troughs of battle. Be warned, however: only those with the strongest of stomachs have ever dared to challenge me!": "joy", "How dare you question my intestinal fortitude?!? I would watch out, friend. I may just slip some cyanide in your relish if I ever have the chance to challenge you!": "anticipation", "Hmph. Well, you should check the by-laws. Major League Eating Official Rulebook page 42, section 4.2.b strictly forbids the usage of cyanide as a food enhancement. You must eat the food as is. So I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the governing board and get you disqualified.": "fear", "I was sick in bed with the flu. My boyfriend took care of me though": "trust", "That is so nice of him. Are you feeling better?": "trust", "Yes, I feel much better now.": "sadness", "That's good to hear. I hope I meet someone that will do that for me.": "trust", "I was leafing through my old photo albums this morning and ran across a picture of me and my mother. I really remember her fondly.": "sadness", "That would bring the tears. I love looking at pictures especially old ones.": "sadness", "Yes, it definitely did. It reminded me of a simpler time, before she abandoned our family to join the local nudist colony. Oh, I do miss her though. She was just the best!": "sadness", "Sounds like you are conflicted. She ran off but she's the best? Are you being sarcastic?": "sadness", "I'm just saying I respect her life choices, but she was a great mom while she was around. I think she's brave.": "trust", "My dog pooped on the floor after I let her in the house.": "disgusted", "That's a tragedy! What ever did you do?!?!": "sadness", "I told her she was a bad dog and had to clean it up.": "disgusted", "Serves her right! These animals can't go around thinking they can poop on our things!": "anger", "Honestly? I have a pretty special nephew. He just solved the Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness Millenium Prize problem.": "anticipation", "Holy moses, he must be as smart as me. I solved that thing in five minutes last week. Child's play.": "sadness", "Child's play is right, the kid is only 6 years old. And you couldn't have, because the Clay Institute says the million dollar prize is still at large, which I'm sure he will be blowing immediately on Tropical Sprite and cocaine.": "sadness", "Yeah, that's what they tell everyone because, in reality, they blew all the prize money on the very same thing themselves. I was pretty peeved that I couldn't even get a dime bag and the sleeziest of hookers.": "anger", "I've been trying really hard to get a promotion at my company but they just hired someone to fill that spot from outside of the company.": "anger", "Ahh, that's too bad, did you mention it to your boss?": "anger", "My boss is pretty temperamental and doesn't like people questioning his decisions, probably a bad idea. ": "anger", "Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe next time!": "sadness", "My roommate's cat passed away last week. There is a heavy air over the household.": "sadness", "I bet. That is so sad. I am so sorry.": "sadness", "Yeah hes really lost without her. It was unexpected. ": "surprise", "I bet! I hope they can find peace soon.": "sadness", "I broke up with my boyfriend last week, and nothing is the same without him.": "sadness", "Time will make it better. You just have to move on.": "sadness", "Yeah, I know but we were planning to start our lives together. We were moving in and now I have to rethink everything.": "sadness", "Better to find out now then move in and invest your time. Trust me it's worse.": "sadness", "I just made the most delicious pie": "trust", "Really? What kind was it?": "sadness", "It was apple pit,  I let it cool to room temp and ate it with ice cream it was so good.": "sadness", "Oh I love apple pie with ice cream, it's such a good combination": "sadness", "I just got a new pair of yeezy shoes and a clean hair cut.": "disgusted", "Nice, I wish I could get a pair of those shoes.": "anger", "I feel on top of the world. I don't know whoever said things can't bring you happiness. They must never owned a pair of Yeezy's": "joy", "How much did you pay for them?": "trust", "I just went camping and build the warmest fire.": "sadness", "I love a warm fire outside while camping! Sounds like a great time.": "sadness", "Yeah, I ended up falling asleep to the dying fire. I felt very safe and secure.": "trust", "Yes that sounds like a wonderful way to sleep.": "joy", "I just had to spend the night all alone in the house. The power was out and It was storming outside.": "fear", "That sounds like it could be quite a scary experience.": "fear", "I started a small fire in the trash can to get some light. It almost started a fire.": "fear", "Oh yeah that's a bit dangerous. Candles are good to have on hang.": "sadness", "I'm a little worried about travelling to dubai": "fear", "Why are you worried?": "fear", "These muslim countries can be a bit fanatic ": "joy", "That is true but Dubai is a bit better": "sadness", "I left my cell phone on the table at starbucks.": "surprise", "Oh no! Was it still there when you went back?": "sadness", "Of course, I'm not worried no one would steal from me.": "fear", "You never know these days. Luckily there are cameras everywhere.": "anger", "I can't help feel stressed about money": "fear", "why? are you having financial problems?": "fear", "Yes I just had a major car repair and it took a massive chunk of my savings. $700": "trust", "oh god , that sounds horrible but at least nothing bas happened to you!": "disgusted", "I felt alone for those 3 weeks she went to visit family": "sadness", "Oh no, what did you do to stay cheerful ?": "sadness", "lol I played xbox games": "joy", "Sounds good, when she got back I hope you schooled her on Halo ?": "sadness", "I usually don't feel the greatest because of health problems. ": "joy", "what kind of health problems ?": "fear", "Blood pressure and crohns disease, as well as, a few minor ones. Not sure why but today I feel really good! Slept well, woke up happy and energized": "joy", "i'm glad you feel good today!": "joy", "You wanna know why I'm not worried about nuclear armageddon? Because I bought a school desk at one of the district auctions, and all I have to do is duck and cover and nuclear fire won't touch me.": "fear", "lol! I remember those drills when I was a kid!": "sadness", "Ahh, then you know exactly what I mean. I don't see a single thing wrong with my plan. I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about North Korea or Iran or Russia or something when it's just like...get a school desk. It's not hard, people.": "fear", "And your largest hardback book will protect you from a tornado as long as you put it over your head and sit in the hall!!": "joy", "Actually a genius, I love it. Parents and teachers tried to tell us that going to school would prepare us for the world. We just didn't know how right they were, did we?": "surprise", "I have a job interview next week. I'm really nervous.": "fear", "That's normal. Try to just be your self. I'm sure it will work out fine.": "sadness", "I'm hoping for the best, but not getting my hopes up too high. I need a new job!!": "anticipation", "Amen, me too.   I hate my current job.": "anticipation", "This is going to sound really pathetic, but I'm so happy my new upholstery/carpet cleaner arrived today. Now I can clean!": "joy", "It's not crazy! I'm all about cleaning up. I LOVE the smell of clean house": "disgusted", "Me too. I live in a first floor apartment and it gets so dusty. Now I'll be able to clean the carpet and the couch! Funny how some strange things lift your spirits.": "anger", "I find it very satisfactory to clean and vacuum :) I bet it will smell so good": "joy", "Hope so. I'm moving out of this apartment and into another one in a few weeks, so I want it to be really clean.": "anger", "My daughter is doing such a great job juggling so many things after having a baby that was premature.": "surprise", "That's good. I know that would be difficult.": "trust", "She really has become such a good mom. I must have done something right ha ha": "sadness", "That is great. I am sure you are proud and you should be!": "joy", "I'm moving into a new apartment soon. I do hope that the neighbors are nice and quiet.": "sadness", "That's always both an exciting time and a nerve-wracking time. I'm in college and I had to move the past two years in a row. This year, I decided I kinda had enough and would just stay put, even though the apartment was just so-so. Do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble?": "joy", "Not really, but my current upstairs neighbors are awful and I feel it'd be worth moving just to get away from them!": "fear", "Oh yeah, I know the type. Where they sound like they're having a parade at 3AM. Sorry you had to go through that. Luckily (or unluckily, if you want to see it that way) I have a loud window AC unit in my apartment, so even if they did make noise, I couldn't hear them over it!": "anger", "Lucky you! And you're bang on about the 3am parade - sounds like a herd of elephants. Maybe I should speak with the current tenant of my new place before moving - just to see how the neighbors are.": "fear", "Two years ago we decided to sell off almost everything we owned and move into our RV so we could travel full-time. I was really scared and worried about literally everything lol.": "joy", "Oh wow that is a huge commitment! How did it go?": "joy", "It has been amazing! We have enjoyed every minute of the last 2 years. My kids are seeing and experiencing things that they may have never been able to see or do. ": "trust", "That is really awesome! Im glad it all worked out for you!": "joy", "Thank you! We have had so much fun an dI now realize that I had nothing to be so worried about lol.": "sadness", "Sometimes I look at old pictures of times in my life and kind of wish I could go back for a while.  Do you ever feel like that?": "sadness", "Yes I feel like that every time I look at old pictures!": "sadness", "It's good to know others feel the same.  I mean, I love my life right now, but sometimes it would be nice to go to something simpler for a bit.": "sadness", "I agree and time jut goes by too fast!": "sadness", "I was looking at old pictures the other day and kind of wishing I could go back to those times in my life.": "sadness", "Do you reach out to your friends from your childhood?": "sadness", "As much as I can, but some have gotten far enough away that I'm not sure how to track them down anymore.": "sadness", "Exhaust all options, social media is a big way to stay connected": "anger", "Sometimes I'm just surprised and amazed at the kindness of others. Recently, one of the maintenance men in our complex delivered a package to me, without my saying anything!": "surprise", "Wow!  What was in the package?": "surprise", "It was a carpet/upholstery cleaner and is quite heavy. I'm disabled, so wouldn't have been able to carry it. They don't normally do deliveries, so I thought that was really nice of him to do that.": "trust", "That was really nice!  What a wonderful surprise!  This act of kindness helps to restore my faith in humanity.": "trust", "The service they provide is so considerate and thoughtful. I'd probably move out of the complex if it wasn't for the staff!": "anger", "My friend and I used to play nintendo all day long. it was fun! We used to play ninja turtles and other fun games. Gosh, i miss her so much": "sadness", "Nice do you still keep in touch with her": "sadness", "yes but she lives in a different country, different time zone so we barely have time to talk. I wish she lived closer": "sadness", "Well if you stay in touch then I'm sure she'll come back...but in the meantime try to take your mind off her or get involved in something fun so you have cool stories to tell her": "sadness", "For me, one of life's greatest pleasures is to be sitting on my porch with a good book and a glass of wine.": "joy", "What book do you enjoy reading?": "joy", "Lots of things. I like historical novels and legal dramas best. What about you? Does reading give you a sense of relaxation?": "joy", "No, actually I'm under a lot of stress right now and I'm in pretty dire straights financially. The only book i'm really reading at this time is the Bible.": "joy", "There's no finer book to help you in distressful times than the Bible. I hope it gives you a sense of peace to read it. So sorry to hear you're stressed out.": "fear", "My cousin recently sent me a video from her phone of my home village. What I saw made me mad and sad!": "anger", "Where is your home village?": "joy", "In the North of Scotland. It used to be a quiet little place, and now there are hideous buildings in really prominent places!": "fear", "That's a shame. I\"m sorry to hear that.": "sadness", "Me to. I was even considering moving back there some day, but not after seeing the mess the planners have made of it.": "sadness", "Do you live in the United States now?": "joy", "Yes. I've been here for about 20 years now and love it. But there's something about where I grew up which pulls (or rather pulled) me back.": "sadness", "Yes it sounds like it was a great place to grow up.": "joy", "i love taking care of my little dog i give him everything he need": "trust", "I love dogs!

We have blue healers, they just make the world better.": "trust", "One time as a surprise for my birthday, my college friends \"kidnapped me\"": "surprise", "Oh my goodness, that must have been terrifying until you figured out what was going on.": "fear", "Nah - I knew that they were just having fun with me!  I was blindfolded and put in the trunk of a big car (I am tiny).": "surprise", "Well at least you had a good time.  Did they do something nice for you after?": "sadness", "Well they took me to a local fountain and dunked me in it!  It was warm out so it was funny and I liked that they cared about me.": "surprise", "i cant stand seeing homeless people in the street, i get really angry and sad at the same time": "anger", "Do you ever offer to help thm?": "sadness", "yes i go to my local charity every weekend": "joy", "GOod for you, I feel bad for never helping out.": "trust", "I won $500 on a scratch off the other day.": "surprise", "Awesome.  What are you going to do with the money.": "joy", "I'm really not sure. I was shocked to win that much. ": "surprise", "Don't spend it all in one place :)": "sadness", "I'll try not to.

If you feel that way again please reach out.": "sadness", "I woke up and the first thing I saw that my cat had decided to play with my shoes and ruin them!": "disgusted", "Oh my, you must have been annoyed with your cat. I guess he just wanted your attention.": "anger", "I was SO mad! I felt so bad being mad at him ": "sadness", "Aw he's just a kitty after all. I'm sure he didn't mean to make you mad.": "sadness", "I was confident that I was going to win that prize": "joy", "What prize was it, or what was the competition, rather? I'm interested to know, but don't want to pry, if you don't feel like saying.": "joy", "It was a $25 Visa gift card. The competition was a talent show. I didn't win unfortunately but It's ok": "surprise", "Ah, gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things, myself included. I hope you continue to do the things that make you competitive and interested.": "surprise", "We decided to try and buy a new kind of sausage from the store. It's SUPER cheap": "sadness", "Was it any good?": "joy", "It was! I was super nervous about it though cause of how cheap it was ": "fear", "Sometimes the cheap things are the best": "sadness", "it is really hard going to the hospital to visit my grandmother": "sadness", "I bet it is!

I've never known a dog with such finesse, yours may have talent.": "anger", "He's an evil genius.  He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.": "sadness", "That's really cool, it makes me want to consider getting a dog.": "sadness", "I am impressed in my sisters camping skills.

How did it affect you?": "anger", "It is hard because cars come up the road all the time and turn around in my drive.": "anger", "Ooh, that would be aggravating.

But still not a good thing.": "sadness", "I am prepared to help my family financially whenever they need it": "joy", "That is really great.

Was it dead or just injured?": "sadness", "Thank goodness it was dead, poor thing is not suffering, but some people can be so cruel.": "disgusted", "That is true.

I can't stand long drives.": "anger", "I put music on and open the window. Otherwise I'll disappear into my own little world, and that's not a good thing to do when you're driving!": "sadness", "Definitely not! Music is a great idea though; I listen to music on all bus rides and car rides.": "fear", "It really helps to pass the time, not to mention it can calm you down. And the drive's quite easy and very pretty, which help.": "trust", "I was so amped yesterday. I got to pick up my now computer for the store! ": "sadness", "Thats awesome.

Have you noticed improvement?": "joy", "yeah I can consistently serve with power and accuracy now. I feel almost decent now.": "joy", "That's magnificent! I've never played tennis myself, but it's a sport I've always enjoyed watching.": "joy", "A while back I caught my partner at the time being dishonest to me.": "sadness", "That is to bad, is it someone you have been with a long time?": "sadness", "We were together for a year and a half and we had a child together shortly before I found out!": "surprise", "Wow, that is really messed up. Did you end up leaving them?": "anger", "High school was a great time, but those days are long gone": "sadness", "also nostalgic ey? i get you, those easy days, no stress, no limits, anything is possible ": "sadness", "No bills to pay, going out to eat with friends all the time, pretty fun": "joy", "i wish we could go back to those days... ": "sadness", "Around 4 months ago, I had major surgery that caused me to be immobile for a few weeks.": "fear", "I'm so sorry you had to go through that! What happened?": "sadness", "Well, I had lots of support from my family, but I felt afraid of getting back into the swing of things for fear of failing. I felt so vulnerable.": "fear", "I'm sure it was a very difficult experience. you must be a really strong person to have gotten through that.": "trust", "I love going to the gym because I feel stronger": "joy", "Nice! How long do you go to the gym for?": "joy", "Probably half a year, been the most consistent in my life, how about you?": "joy", "I never even leave the house! I am the opposite of you!": "fear", "It's tough to talk to my parents, but I try to talk about things we don't disagree on": "sadness", "That is unfortunate, what do you usually avoid talking about?": "sadness", "Anything political or religious really, or relationships": "trust", "Well I hope one day your parents are more accepting!": "trust", "I had my dog for 13 years before she passed away last year from cancer. It was devastating!": "sadness", "Oh no I am so sorry to hear that. Are you planning on getting  a new dog? ": "sadness", "Probably not for a while. She was a great companion, but I don't think my heart is ready to bring in a new dog quite yet.": "sadness", "Aww, yeah I know what you mean. Dogs are so lovable. I also have a new pup myself. I got him a couple years ago": "sadness", "I was horribly wronged by someone I thought I could trust. The feeling was devastating, and I've always struggled with forgiveness.": "sadness", "Oh my, what happened? I'm so sorry, no one should treat anyone they care about poorly.": "sadness", "They were dishonest and physically cruel. We have gone our separate ways, but I truly hope they can learn to treat others better.": "sadness", "I'm sorry hun, you deserve to be treated better than that. I hope you know that.": "sadness", "Last month I came home from work and noticed my cat wasn't feeling well, so I rushed her to the vet. I had to put her down.": "sadness", "I'm so sorry, that is the worst feelings. I had to put my dog down as well. I know you did the right thing.": "sadness", "I know, I just really miss her. Poor cancer kitty. I loved her so much.": "sadness", "Cats are really some of the greatest companions. How old did she live?": "trust", "MY roommate got a new cat last week, and we finally let them meet today. I was so nervous and worried about it.": "fear", "It went okay. My cat bopped him a little and growled a lot but no real swipes. So better than expected I guess.": "sadness", "That's good some things just take time": "joy", "When I was pregnant with my first born, it was considered a high risk pregnancy. It made me very worried and anxious throughout.": "fear", "I can imagine. How did things turn out?": "fear", "I had to have emergency surgery in the end, but being able to hold my healthy baby was the greatest blessing I could have asked for.": "trust", "I'm so glad you made it through": "trust", "I'm so happy summer classes are officially over and I'll be able to relax for a week!": "joy", "Great what will you be doing during your time off ? ": "joy", "I'm not even sure what to do with all this time! I guess I should relax or have some leisure time, but everything in me says to try and be productive even on break. It's that school mentality.": "joy", "I agree with you,you'll feel good about yourself being productive !": "joy", "My sister came to visit from out of state. It was the first time we've seen her in nearly a decade!": "surprise", "That must have been exciting to see her after so long. Does she live very far away?": "joy", "Yes she lives on the other side of the country. We had a nice dinner, but my boyfriend is a loud chewer and a sloppy eater. It was quite embarrassing!": "sadness", "That's a shame. Does your sister have a bad impression of your boyfriend after having dinner with you?": "anger", "I just bought a new dress and I can't wait to wear it this weekend.": "joy", "I love buying new clothes! Where do you think you'll wear it to?": "anticipation", "I'm going to wear it to a party. Everyone will have their eyes on me!": "joy", "How exciting! I bet you'll look flawless!": "joy", "A few months ago I could barely walk up a flight of stairs without having to catch my breath, but I bit the bullet and have been training.": "fear", "how has that been going for you?": "joy", "Wonderful! It's definitely hard work, but I continue on, even on the days I don't want to. Today I discovered I can now comfortably run an uphill mile and I feel very confident!": "joy", "that's amazing!": "joy", "My boss told me about a potential job opportunity and I've been waiting to hear if it's going to happen": "fear", "nervous?": "joy", "A little bit. I am mostly excited about it though": "joy", "that's good! excitement and nervousness are both the same, so it's very hard to tell, but it's amazing you are able to convert all the bad feelings into positive ones! good luck ": "anticipation", "I was very prepared for my final exam. It was so easy.": "joy", "That's a great feeling. Going in knowing you'll do well, and then actually doing well.": "joy", "If I'm being honest, I made an answer key from the quizzes we took this semester. As they say, work smart, not hard.": "joy", "Ingenuity like that will reward you in the real world. Academia is a system, and if you game it, you've won.  ": "joy", "My cousin was swinging recklessly on my hammock and ended up breaking it!": "fear", "Oh no! I would be very furuios!": "anger", "I was very upset, especially considering how long it took me to get it set up. I loved laying in my peaceful hammock to read.": "joy", "I would be devastated! Maybe he wont do it agian.": "sadness", "I received a phone call the other day from a friend I hadn't heard from in ages.": "sadness", "Oh wow, I bet that was nice. Hopefully y'all had a good talk.": "sadness", "We reminisced about old times. It was very nice, indeed. It was nice hearing from him, especially during some rough times!": "sadness", "Well, that is fantastic. Hopefully y'all will be able to meet up in the future real soon too. ": "joy", "I have a weekend of nothing but relaxation planned for this weekend.": "joy", "That sounds amazing. How are you planning to relax?": "joy", "I have some leftover roast in the fridge so I don't even have to leave the house. I'm going to watch a lot of netflix and MAYBE do a little laundry.": "disgusted", "That sounds very relaxing. Don't forget the snacks for netflix!": "joy", "I keep having these dreams that I am out in public and somehow my clothes disappear. It's awful. ": "sadness", "that could possibly indicate that you are a free creature! and you don't like to be caged! don't worry about it the dream, as they are only metaphorical": "sadness", "I hate those dreams, I feel anything but free. They're really uncomfortable and make me nothing but a ball of negative emotions like anxiety as I spend the majority of the dream trying to find clothes and get away from people. ": "fear", "Don't worry, you're wearing clothes now aren't you? :)": "sadness", "One of my friends recently bought a house. I really wish I could afford a house.": "anger", "Wow that is great for your friend! and don't stress it, we are still young and have plenty of time to save up for a house!": "trust", "I'm starting to feel like I will never be able to afford a house. They're just so expensive. And the market has been going up here about 5% a year for the past 10 years.": "anticipation", "Wow that is crazy, I know how you feel, the best solution is to probably find a cheap place to rent out until it is possible to buy one. ": "sadness", "I ended up staying at home for the holidays": "sadness", "why is that? comfort ?": "joy", "No all my family lives out of state. I didn't feel like traveling, but I just ended up sitting at home and watching lord of the rings in the dark.": "sadness", "OH NICE! THAT'S SOUNDS SO AMAZING, I love watching lord of the rings every now and then, did you watch all the sequels all over again?": "sadness", "I bumped into a friend from middle school. We chatted for a while": "sadness", "Wow, that must have been nice to catch up. When was the last time you saw your friend?": "sadness", "Before 9th grade. I moved away that summer. Seeing her brought back a lot of good memories": "sadness", "Seeing old friends that you have not contacted in so long is a nice feeling. ": "sadness", "I had a doctors appointment at 9 am and they kept me waiting for almost 2 hours.": "fear", "Really!? That is very unprofessional of them to make you wait for so long.": "sadness", "It was terrible I ended being late for work because of their horrible service.": "anger", "That is frustrating. You should complain to them.": "anger", "The past few months have been terribly rough, but I think I can say that they have made me stronger.": "sadness", "Oh no, I am sorry that you have been having a rough time, but I am glad to hear that you have grown from your experiances.": "sadness", "Thank you. I hope that I can move forward and at least learn from these hardships.": "joy", "Yeah I believe that you will be able to, but never forget you are not alone! I am always here if you need some moral support :)": "sadness", "I really hate when people can't hold themselves accountable for their own actions and decisions.": "anger", "I agree. So often does pride get in the way of personal growth and reflection.": "joy", "Absolutely. Yet, these people have a horrible way of twisting things in order to guilt you, even if you'd done nothing wrong! It's a very manipulating and confusing feeling.": "sadness", "You'd hope folks would grow up, but sometimes people get set in their ways, and become impossible to change.": "sadness", "I received a very odd message today. It came from a person who I blocked online, but they managed to find a loophole and messaged me by way of an inactive group.": "sadness", "Oh no, what did they say? ": "sadness", "They were just trying to find ways to contact me. I have literally blocked them on all social media. It seems borderline stalkish, and it makes me very anxious.": "anger", "That is really creepy, I would feel anxious too. I think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messages,Feel free to also call me if you need anything! :)": "fear", "I'm going rock climbing with some friends!": "sadness", "That sounds fun and scary! You must be pretty fit to take on that challenge.": "fear", "I have done some climbing indoors for practice, but never done a big climb out doors, so who know how it will go.": "fear", "I'm sure that there will be some differences, but I'm sure you will nail it! Just remember to be safe!": "sadness", "I keep having these really weird nightmares at night.": "fear", "oh my, what are they about?": "anger", "I'm usually in a big city that I'm familiar with, and roam around in the dream until I get stalked, jumped, and sometimes very hurt.": "fear", "wow sounds like some inception plot line, you need to learn how to control the dream": "joy", "Today I was quite impressed with my endurance during my work out. A few months ago, I couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without losing my breath.": "joy", "Sound like you're making a lot of progress!": "joy", "I sure have, but it's such hard work. I make sure to work out, even on the days that I don't want to. It's definitely taken a lot of will power.": "joy", "That's great! All the hard work is paying off.": "joy", "I had a high risk pregnancy up until a few months ago. I felt the most grateful I'd ever been when my baby turned out healthy.": "trust", "Congrats, that must have been a very stressful time leading up the the birth.": "joy", "It was a really rough pregnancy that ended with a very painful surgery. It was not pretty, but definitely worth it. I would have taken any amount of pain as long as my son was born healthy and safe.": "trust", "You sound like a great mother. I'm sure your son is very lucky to have you.": "trust", "I just learned my first trick in ice skating, a triple spin twirl kick front flip.": "surprise", "Wow that sounds challenging! You must have some serious strength to pull that off!": "joy", "I never thought I would have the balance to perform such a feat. I think I can no qualify for the Olympics. ": "surprise", "You should definitely try! It would be tough, but if you have the determination, it would be so worth it.": "sadness", "I just started college again, and while I'm doing great in school, it has lead me to feel very lonely with a lack of social life.": "sadness", "Oh no! You should try to make some more friends with your classmates.": "sadness", "That sound like a good idea if they weren't online classes. Next semester I have a few on campus courses, so I'm hoping I'll be able to make at least one new friend.": "sadness", "I hope you're able to find some friends in the next semester then!": "joy", "This upcoming semester will be my first time taking 5 classes at once. I'm pretty worried that I may have taken on too much.": "fear", "Yeah that sounds hectic. You think you can do it?": "sadness", "I'm not sure. The more I think about it, the more I doubt myself. I also have a baby, so I'm hoping I'll be able to juggle everything at once.": "anticipation", "Yeah sounds like a handful! Maybe you should weigh your options and do whats best for you adn your family. ": "fear", "I adore my girlfriend. I am getting very serious about not leaving her side.": "fear", "That is great to here!": "joy", "Thank you. Do you have a romantic interest?": "joy", "Not at the moment. I'm too focused on bettering myself.": "sadness", "Summer in the South calls for many unwanted visitors of the insect type!": "disgusted", "I'm from the south too! Are you talking about mosquitoes by any chance?": "anger", "Mosquitoes, and those dreadful flying ants. They're everywhere!": "anger", "One day we'll find a way to repay them all the misery they've caused us.": "sadness", "Lately I've felt proud of my success as a newly single mother. It gets lonely sometimes, but I can honestly say I've been doing everything I can and more.": "joy", "Keep up the good work! You will do good in life and be a good role model for your kids. ": "joy", "Thank you! I definitely have a drive to feel strong for them. I hope some day they can realize my efforts.": "trust", "They will notice how caring you are! Dont ever cut yourself short!": "sadness", "I have a plethora of amazing friends. One of mine recently drove me from Georgia to South Florida": "surprise", "That does sound like a good friend. How long of a drive is that?": "trust", "It is an 8 hour drive! Florida is a very long state": "joy", "You're lucky to have such a good friend!": "trust", "I recently totaled my car. There were no injuries but I feel absolutely terrible": "sadness", "Oh no! I've been there. How did it happen?": "sadness", "It was very wet and I took a turn at too high of a speed.": "sadness", "I'm glad your safe! Those roads can be dangerous.": "trust", "My mom and I haven't always had the best relationship. Recently I've had to tell myself to let her in more. It's been challenging.": "trust", "I hope that your relationship continues to strengthen.": "trust", "Thank you. I know that, even though it's challenging, I need to be patient in order to improve our relationship.": "trust", "I agree. Life is short and having these relationships is very important": "sadness", "I have had the toughest time getting my pet rat to get along with others. She's always been very aggressive!": "trust", "Oh no! I hope it dont bite anyone. That can be nervwrecking.": "disgusted", "She's never bitten anyone, thankfully, but she gets crazy with other rats. To my surprise though, I've recently found her snuggling with the others she usually tries to fight!": "surprise", "Im glad it worked out well. I bet your finally content with her being around other rats. ": "joy", "This past month, I was able to visit Six Flags!": "joy", "That's neat and sounds like a lot of fun!": "joy", "It was amazing. The last time I was at an amusement park had to have been over a decade ago!": "surprise", "I have not been in years! Was it as fun this time as it was years ago?": "sadness", "The other day I noticed my pet has a growth on her lower belly. I fear it may be a tumor.": "fear", "What kind of pet is it? Hope your animal is okay!": "trust", "She's a rat, so her body is very frail. I'm sad that she likely will not make it. She's been with me through thick and thin.": "sadness", "I heard rats make awesome pets, I'm so sorry! Is your rat in pain?": "disgusted", "I let the girl of my dreams slip away. Now I am alone.": "sadness", "I'm sure with the help and support he will be alright..": "trust", "I hope so. I think that time heals all wounds.": "sadness", "Definitely, I think so too, time and right care.": "trust", "I recently went to the pool and lost my suit. My trunks were in the water without me!": "sadness", "Oh my! I hope you were the only one there! otherwise that would have been scary!": "fear", "I was not, unfortunately.

I kept thinking I would swerve into their lane and collide into them": "fear", "i'm glad you didn't ": "sadness", "I've been trying to be extra supportive towards my husband. ": "trust", "That's nice to hear.  It's always a good thing in a marriage to show each other support through thick and thin.": "trust", "Yes - so true. His mom is dying, and he is working long hours on top of it. I feel really bad for him.": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that.  Just knowing that he has you to lean on probably goes a very long way in helping him get through that.": "sadness", "My friend who I haven't seen in a long time came to visit. She married a very wealthy man and I was a bit envious": "anger", "Oh no! Were you envious because you liked her yourself, or because you don't have a wealthy husband?": "anger", "She drove up in a fancy car and seems like she doesn't have a care in the world.

I've taped the local new's winning lottery numbers and I'm going to buy a ticket with the same numbers and give it to my butler": "surprise", "That's hilarious! Is he usually down for a good prank?": "anger", "I'm not sure he likes being the target of pranks, but he likes to prank me and this prank is to get back at him for a prank he pulled on me and my cousin": "fear", "Well, that's fair. If he pulls them, he has to be willing to have them pulled on him, too.": "anger", "My friend just took her kids to Disneyland and I feel a little bad about it.": "sadness", "Why's that?": "sadness", "I'd been wanting to do that trip with my kids for years.

I felt pretty let down - but hopefully I can make the trip to see her soon.": "sadness", "you should defently and don't let this affect you too much, maybe she has a good reason": "anger", "My sister threw up the other day and made a huge mess.": "anger", "that must have been an explosion and a half, did  you clean it up?": "anger", "Fortunately no- she cleaned it up. But she had just had spaghetti and it was floating in it. It was so gross!": "disgusted", "i can imagine, that's gross as hell": "disgusted", "I was livid when I went to work the other day and saw my car was broken in to": "anger", "oh no! that's terrible! I've had that happen before and it sucks": "sadness", "I heard it was happening in other areas but didn't expect it here because we live in a nice neighborhood. So frustrating": "fear", "I can imagine. did they steal anything?": "anger", "Every year when the kids go back to school, it brings back so many memories of when my kids were going to school.": "sadness", "I know what you mean.  I love to see all the pictures, and think back to how little mine used to be.": "sadness", "I would cry the first day of school every year, especially the milestone years. Now my grandchildren are starting school. Time flies by too quickly": "sadness", "They do seem to be grown before you know it.  Make you wonder how if goes so fast!": "sadness", "So everyone is gone form the house and i found a thing of thin mints, and I ate the whole thing for breakfast.": "surprise", "Sometimes it's ok to indulge. Did it give you a stomachache though lol?": "sadness", "LOL, I swear it was like I sat down and they were gone!  Probably gave myself diabetes. So not going to be able to eat the rest of the day!": "sadness", "You should follow up with a few veggies later on maybe to balance it out. I know that feeling though. Its just so good you can't eat just one lol": "sadness", "Sigh, I have no self control, definatley need a veggie or two today now! Probably should knix those form the pantry": "sadness", "My father passed away in November, it's made me feel empty ever since.": "sadness", "I'm so sorry for your loss! It's so hard to lose a parent.": "sadness", "I didn't think it would hit me hard. I felt like I was prepared. ": "joy", "Sadly, I don't think we can ever be prepared for that kind of loss.": "sadness", "I surprised my girlfriend with Chik-Fil-A breakfast this morning when she got off work.": "surprise", "Wow,  that's so nice of you": "trust", "She works nights, and had no idea I was coming. I knew she had a bad night so I wanted to do something nice for her.": "trust", "That is cool.  You are really so caring ": "trust", "I recently was laid off from my job. I haven't found anything yet, but I'm trying to stay positive that I will soon.": "anticipation", "Oh darn, that sucks.  Keeping a positive attitude is the way to go!

I feel so embarrassed.": "sadness", "Oh no! Can you replace it?": "sadness", "I'm trying to find a new one, but this one was rare and hard to find. ": "sadness", "I'm sure your friend will be understanding that it was a mistake.": "sadness", "My birthday was last week and I never heard from my brother OR my sister to wish me a happy birthday.": "surprise", "oh no I am sorry to hear that! They must have been really busy and it must have slipped their mind": "sadness", "I guess I shouldn't expect so much from them and let myself get let down like I have.": "sadness", "I am sure they had their reasons, maybe you should give them a call and see if everything is alright. They may be going through their own problems right now. ": "sadness", "The older I get, the more relaxed and just a simple happy and calm feeling I have. It is nice to just enjoy being alive.": "joy", "I agree. The sound of birdsong, a gentle breeze on a summer's day, the purring of your tabby-cat. You can't beat that, can you?": "joy", "Those examples are definitely the simple pleasures of life. It makes me want to go outside and listen to the birds and smell the flowers.": "sadness", "You should! Forget about your worries, if only for a moment. You'll return feeling refreshed.": "sadness", "I went swimming the other day and when I jump into the water and came back up, my bathing suit top was pulled over my breast and I was wandering why everyone was staring at me.": "fear", "Yikes, that's not a fun situation. Did you figure it out pretty quickly?": "fear", "Yes I did realize fairly fast why everyone was staring. I looked down and seen my breast exposed. ": "sadness", "That's good, I'd be mortified if that happened to me.": "sadness", "I think my cat likes my new girlfriend more than he likes me now.": "surprise", "I've had that happen before. My cat is definitely more my wife's cat now. Does he still cuddle up with you?": "trust", "Yea he loves to sit on my lap while i work, but prefers her side of the bed now when he sleeps.

It's like as soon as my wife is available to sit or lay with, I'm chopped liver.": "sadness", "My grandfather passed away not too long ago, i received a bunch of items he left for me. ": "sadness", "I'm sorry for your loss, I bet you two were close. What did he leave you?": "sadness", "Some interesting antiques, grandfather clocks, and a lot of items related to his work for the house of representatives. Interesting stuff": "anger", "Oh he worked for congress? That's very interesting. That sounds like an awesome haul of vintage stuff.": "sadness", "I had to let my dad borrow my car the other day.

Your dad is very trustworthy.": "trust", "I ca not believe what happened the other night at my friends house, I'll never show my face again.": "sadness", "Can you please give a little more detail about what happened at your friends house that made you not want to show your face??": "anger", "Sure, I fell asleep on the chair and had a dream, in my dream I went to the restroom, so yeah, I peed right there in their chair.": "sadness", "How embarrassing! I did that one time when I was sleeping in my bed and I thought I got up and went to the bathroom to pee, but I did not go to the bathroom, I peed my pants in the bed. ": "sadness", "Yes, it was not fun, but good to know I am not the only one.": "sadness", "I enjoy helping the wildlife in my area where I live. I give them a helping hand. I give them water, birdseed, my left over food. The animals love watermelon and cantaloupe. ": "trust", "That is so cool, my mother in law has bears come into her yard! I'd be happy with the hummingbirds, so pretty.": "joy", "I just have the small non dangerous type of wildlife that I like to help Birds, rabbits, squirrels and such. No big bad bears!

We just got a new puppy this last weekend also! What kind is yours?": "trust", "Its a long hair chihuahua and a short hair chihuahua. He has the most adorable under bite!": "surprise", "Aw that is super cute! Dogs bring such happiness to a home.": "trust", "I found out my wife was having an affair, the worst part is i knew the guy and welcomed him in my home and was kind to him.": "sadness", "Oh man, I'm really sorry you have to go through that. Betrayal like that is so painful. How are you doing?": "fear", "I'm learning to live my live without her, it's tough. Some honesty would have made the way it ended much better. Thanks for the kind words.": "sadness", "Of course, no one deserves to have their heartbroken like that. I hope you find someone who treats you with the respect and kindness you deserve.": "sadness", "I went on a soda fast for two days so that I could pray for strength for my husband while he tried to quit smoking. I am addicted to soda so it was hard. I made it though and I was able to pray for him multiple times during the two days.": "sadness", "Sugar is very addicting! I'm glad you could make it": "joy", "Yeah me too. The lack of caffeine made me get a bad headache that took three days to get rid of.": "anger", "Caffeine headaches are no joke.": "sadness", "No, they suck!!": "anger", "I recently had an argument with a friend. Even though I talked ot her about it and let her know how I felt, my daughter overheard me discussing it with my husband. She thought I was being two faced, which lead to a long discussion. I felt guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong.": "sadness", "Sounds like you were just misunderstood. I discuss things with my husband, too, and it's not like talking behind someone's back. That's what married couples do. Don't feel bad. ": "sadness", "Yeah, I just felt like I set a bad example for my daughter, even thought she misunderstood. I guess it was a teachable moment though..": "sadness", "Yes, just tell her your home is a safe place to talk. It's okay to open up in the family. ": "sadness", "That's good advice. Thanks!": "fear", "I found huge box full of my old cd's recently, found a ton of old pc games i used to play, reminded me of a simpler time!": "sadness", "Awesome! Did you play any of them after you found the box?": "surprise", "I did, i played a few sessions of age of empires and i plan to play some command and conquer red alert tonight before bed, still great games.": "joy", "Neat!

Even though everything is becoming digital, I find there is something special about the physical copies!": "anticipation", "I got turned down for a job I really wanted.": "sadness", "Ugh, sorry! You must be disappointed. But remember if the door doesn't open, it probably wasn't yours. There's something else in store for you!": "sadness", "Thanks.  But yes, I was really dejected.  I thought I'd interviewed well and had a good enough resume.": "joy", "Sometimes they already have a candidate in mind but have to go through the motion...the same thing happened to my husband. Your time will come.": "fear", "When my wife left me, i felt worthless and like giving up on life to be honest, I've since started making some positive changes and and more optimistic ": "anticipation", "I can't even imagine how devastating that would be. I think you must be really strong to be able to move forward.": "sadness", "Well, Like the saying goes, get busy living or get busy dying. I'm not sure if i'll ever find someone i truly love but life goes on!": "sadness", "You might, but I believe you can have a full life as a single person, too.": "sadness", "I bought a 20 foot boat. I believe it will be able to handle the large lake that I will be taking it on.": "joy", "Wow! A 20 foot boat, that must be amazing to take out on the lake! How much did it cost you?": "surprise", "It cost me around $30,000. It has all the latest features, that should keep me safe in all but the most extreme conditions. ": "trust", "Id love to own a boat, are you using it for leisure or fishing etc? ": "joy", "It has been a dream of mine for a long time. I am mainly going to use it for fishing. But might have to take my wife tubing to make her happy. ": "joy", "They both sound like great plans! Tubing would be a great way to keep her happy while you fish haha!": "joy", "We should have a lot of fun this summer with it! Makes up for all the hard work saving up for it. ": "joy", "I hope you do! It makes you feel like you've actually earned it!": "joy", "I like like loaning money to friends. It can ruin friendships and sometimes doesn't get paid back.": "trust", "I'm always leery of loaning money to friends": "joy", "Yeah, I meant don't like, sorry.

I have tried lending money to friends but finally had to stop after never getting it back": "surprise", "Last summer, my dog went missing. We looked for him everywhere and called all of our neighbors. No one had seen him.": "sadness", "Oh no! How sad! Did you ever find him?": "sadness", "After a week of looking for him and checking the shelters, a neighbor found his body under her house. He had gotten under there and couldn't find a way out. I was so heart broken and so were my daughters.": "sadness", "Oh, how awful! I'm so sorry!": "sadness", "I try to skateboard with my kids everyday. They love it, and it makes me feel young again.": "sadness", "Wow, very cool. The last time i tried to skateboard i almost broke my tailbone. props to you though!": "surprise", "It can be scary some times, but its worth it.": "fear", "Is it though? haha. If you can do it without falling down then you are doing better than me. Probably a good bonding experience i'd imagine. ": "sadness", "My daughters 6th birthday was recently, unfortunately her mothers side of the family didn't show up, even though they all rsvp'd": "sadness", "Too bad for them! My sons 6th birthday was just last week, and we had a fun party. There so much easier to please when their little lol.": "joy", "Hah yea, she was sad at first but there was plenty of presents and people who love her around to distract her. They grow up fast. ": "sadness", "They do. I can't believe how fast the time goes.": "sadness", "The other week, a friend of mine told me there was an opening where he worked and to get him a resume. I took to long to get my resume together and they gave the job to someone else.": "sadness", "That must have been aggravating! Job hunting is so hard.": "anger", "It would have been nice. Less pay, but I would have had to work less. Oh well, guess I'll try harder next time.": "sadness", "Maybe something better will come along!": "sadness", "The other day I was running late. So, I jumped up and threw on some clothes then ran out of the house.": "disgusted", "Well I hope you got there in time and nothing bad happened.": "fear", "I did but when after I was out for a while I noticed the shirt I was wearing was covered in grease stains. I apparently washed it with my husbands work clothes.": "sadness", "Oh know! I hope you weren't heading to a job interview, haha.": "joy", "I have MS, and sometimes I have bowl problems.": "joy", "I'm so sorry. Have you tried any natural remedies?": "sadness", "No, I've tried science remedies. I like those kinds better.": "sadness", "I hope you find something that gives you some relief!": "fear", "My son got a remote control car for his birthday. Its really cool.": "sadness", "That's awesome. Did you get him it? I bet he loves it.": "joy", "No, his grandpa did. But, after he went to bed, I went outside and played with it for a while.": "sadness", "Haha I would've done the same. Those toys always make me lose myself. They're so much fun!": "sadness", "Someone broke into my car the other day, but they didnt steal anything.": "anger", "Wow you were lucky! It has happened to me before too. It feels so violating.": "sadness", "I know! I feel both violated and kind of sad because I have nothing in my car worth stealing.": "sadness", "Because you were not in it. :)": "sadness", "There was an elderly lady at my church who was blind and could not hear well so you had to talk really loud for her to hear you. She was very faithful about coming to church so our preacher picked her up and took her home for every service. When she needed help, we took turns helping her. ": "trust", "That is so nice of you all! I know she appreciates it.": "trust", "When I saw that she needed help, I always tried to give her directions based on where she was with her walker. I liked helping her. She recently passed away and I miss her.": "trust", "Aww, I'm so sorry but know you made a difference in her life.": "sadness", "Yes, she loved everyone she met. She would say she couldn't remember everyone's names, but she loved them anyway.": "sadness", "I took my son to kindergarten the other day. He loves it so far!": "joy", "that is good! did he make any friends?": "joy", "You bet! He made a girlfriend on the bus by talking about Zelda.": "sadness", "That is really cute!": "joy", "Lately, my family and I have been very blessed. We are all happy and healthy. All of our major bills have already been paid for the month, and we have been going to a three week long revival at a local church.": "trust", "That's awesome!

I try to take pictures of everything.": "joy", "I couldn't believe Aretha Franklin passed away last week.": "sadness", "Neither could I.

We had red beans and rice and with sausage.  I'm as full as a tick!": "sadness", "That sounds amazing! How long does it take to make the beans? Do you have to soak them? ": "joy", "I had to soak them for 3 hours.  I think that's what makes that meal so satisfying - the wait!": "joy", "I can smell the beans and sausage as we speak.. I always find after cooking I'm never hungry. Maybe that's because I snacked the entire time I was cooking.": "disgusted", "I do the same thing!": "joy", "Found out some bad news today about my kids custody case.": "sadness", "Oh no.  In those cases, it's either the best news or the worst news.": "sadness", "Yeah, it really is. Due to a technicality custody is reverting to their father.": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that.

I guess that's painful!": "sadness", "My ex and I broke up because he decided that he would no longer be willing to leave his job from overwork, like 70 plus hours a week.": "sadness", "I am sorry. Breakups are the worst. Did he just not want to give up overtime or he worked 70hours always?": "anger", "He claims that he kept getting raises and felt obligated to work even harder. So he just kept working more and more and I rarely got to spend time with him and he was always tired.": "anger", "That's rough but you deserve someone who is willing or wants to make the time for you. Never settle for less than what you are willing to settle for.": "sadness", "My ex recently said that he was wanting to get back together. I'm not sure how to feel about it, we've been getting along great since we broke up.": "sadness", "Why did yall break up?": "sadness", "The straw that broke the camels back is that he broke a promise that he would leave his job if they were over working him too much.

The best I can imagine is that the water quality dropped, and they died. I imagine it was pollution. ": "fear", "I hope they are not using the lake for drinking water .": "joy", "I have a really big game coming up this weekend. I haven't played soccer since I was a kid and have been really nervous about joining an adult league. ": "joy", "Good luck!

Thinking I should keep it.": "trust", "Do you get much use out of it, or is it just collection dust?": "joy", "Kind of just dust. It meant a lot to her that I have it so I just don't think I can let it go.": "anticipation", "I guess you can hang on to it, or maybe there's someone else you both know who can show it some proper lovin'.": "sadness", "One of my friends managed to pay off their first house at the age of 25.": "sadness", "well dang! that is very impressive!

That is terrible, do you know what happened? ": "sadness", "My younger brothers went in my room and messed with all my things. I am so angry about it": "anger", "Oh no, I am sure they meant no harm, they always say that they are more curious when they are young. ": "sadness", "Today when I was home alone I was snuggling with a stuffed bunny my ex got me, because I missed him. I feel so pathetic.": "sadness", "It will pass in time, even though it feels awful right now.": "sadness", "I hope so, I'm tired of feeling so miserable.

Did you have any feelings for him? ": "trust", "No, the whole thing was really weird and kind of embarrassing really. He sat in the desk in front and would turn around and basically ask me to kiss him in front of the whole class. I only knew him from that class. I usually would just smash my binder in his face instead.": "sadness", "Hahaha, that is so cute, I am sure he loved that you teased him like that! I bet your classmates also had a good laugh! ": "sadness", "I've been out of a job for a while but someone I know has offered me an opportunity to do some work in my field": "trust", "Wow!

I thought it was pretty intense to watch": "fear", "I have seen that before. I have no idea how they can do that.": "surprise", "I've been packing, packing, packing and cleaning. ": "joy", "o That sounds exciting. Moving or spring cleaning?": "joy", "Moving, not sure when yet but I like to be  ahead of the game. I hate being rushed.": "sadness", "Ya last time I moved I was packing for about 6 months. It's smarter to do it a little at a time and get things purged and organized. ": "joy", "Someone hit my car while I was shopping. I am so mad they didn't even leave a note.": "anger", "Oh no that is terrible, I can not believe that they would drive off without leaving any contact information! How bad was the accident? ": "anger", "Huge dent, I can't believe someone could do that and drive off.": "anger", "Wow, that is terrible. I hope that you are able to catch them or find surveillance videos of who did it, because most malls do have cameras in the parking lots.": "anger", "I remember back when I got to pick up my dog at the airport when she was a puppy.": "sadness", "Aww were you excited when you picked her up?": "surprise", "Oh man, I sure was. And she was so excited to get out of that box.": "sadness", "I bet! What kind of dog is she?": "trust", "My brother isn't very good with money but i just lent him some": "trust", "Uh oh, be careful about that, you don't want him becoming dependent on you for handouts. ": "sadness", "Yeah I don't do that often, but i am certain he will be able to pay me back this time": "joy", "Well that's good. I hope it works out for both of you, maybe you could give him some budgeting tips. ": "trust", "I just can't believe some people. I watched this woman throw her trash on a homeless man today.": "disgusted", "Oh my god, you should have reported her.": "anger", "I definitely stepped in and made sure this man knew he didn't deserve that. Just makes me so mad to share a country with people like that.": "anger", "I am really appalled at people these days.": "disgusted", "So we are waiting on some news to move. I feel like it will be this week that we find out.": "anticipation", "Not sure yet, waiting to find all of that out. I hate waiting though.": "anticipation", "Me too.

I was really wanting that job.": "anticipation", "Just remember to keep your head up and don't give up!": "sadness", "So I was driving to work yesterday and the driver next to me opened their door and threw up everywhere.": "disgusted", "I do hope they stopped the car at least ! That sounds disgusting, but its better than throwing up in the car right ?": "disgusted", "Yes they were at a stop light but I was so grossed out after seeing that.": "disgusted", "I can imagine when something unexpected like that happens. I do hope they are ok now :) Sorry you had to witness that !": "surprise", "I am so ready to find out where we are moving to.": "joy", "New adventures!

It'll just take some time.": "sadness", "yeah but you never know , you may make life changing friendships so be patient!": "sadness", "Last week I was at the grocery store picking up body wash. There were so many to chose from, but I couldn't help but buy my trusted brand that has served me well for so many years.": "sadness", "You gotta stick with what you know sometimes.": "sadness", "Yes, why try something new when what you have been using has worked so well. ": "sadness", "That's right. There's so sense in deviating. ": "fear", "I have to show some brand loyalty! ": "trust", "I have so much to do today, but it's raining. I'm OK with just staying at home and doing nothing.": "sadness", "I feel you there, I have a ton of stuff to do, but I can't get any of it done in this rain. ": "joy", "It sucks. Maybe it'll be dry this weekend.": "sadness", "I really hope so, I am not sure how much longer I can let my yard grow before it gets too wild.

": "trust", "When I go out to a restaurant, I order gluten free food items.  I have to trust that the cook and server take my request seriously.  If not, my food could be \"gluten free\" but cross contaminated with foods that aren't and still make me ill.": "anticipation", "What kind of illness occurs if food is cross contaminated? I'm so sorry this happens to you.": "sadness", "If it's mild, just stomach pains for a few days.  If I were to say, eat a bun that was supposed to be gluten free and it was full gluten, my joints also inflame.  So you see it can affect more than just my stomach!": "joy", "You suffer from it more severely than most people I know, this can be devastating to people. ": "sadness", "Inflammation is the devil.  I'm just glad I found out how to manage it to improve my quality of life.": "joy", "We ordered 3 diet cokes with dinner the other night, and they all came out a different shade of coloring!": "sadness", "Wow that is weird.

I like the new Freestyle machines, it's always just right.": "joy", "While cleaning out our closets, I always find some old item that reminds me how little the girls used to be.  Last time it was a cute pair of jeans in toddler sizing we saved to make \"jean purses\" out of someday.  My kid is 14 this week!!!": "sadness", "aww. I understand you. That feeling is priceless.": "sadness", "It definitely triggers some emotions!  Then I'm torn between keeping it a little longer or finally purging.": "sadness", "It's alright to feel such sentiments buddy :)": "sadness", "My wife made me pancakes for breakfast. I have a full belly and feel rather happy now. ": "joy", "Yum!!! I love pancakes. Is it your favorite food too?": "joy", "One of my favorite breakfast foods. She also made some thick sliced bacon. She treats me so well.": "surprise", "That is great you have a sweet wife! ": "trust", "For sure, no other woman I would rather have. ": "anger", "It is so great to hear about a happy couple :)": "joy", "How can I complain when she gets up early to make me such a great meal!": "joy", "I bet she is a great cook!": "surprise", "I told my brother that I was planning to propose to my best friend, but I hope he keeps it a secret!": "anticipation", "That sounds exciting! Is he good at keeping secrets?": "trust", "He lets things slip once in a while, but this is a pretty big secret so I have confidence in him.": "joy", "Fingers crossed for you!  I'm sure it will be fine.  Are you nervous?": "fear", "I have a friend who is struggling right now in her business.  I'm trying hard to be there to support and cheer her on.": "trust", "Being a business owner is hard. I'm sure she is grateful for your help.": "trust", "RIght?

": "trust", "ooh nice! just start to SAVE, SAVE,SAVE where ever you can and you will get there.": "joy", "I know, it would look perfect in front of my double wide mobile home! There is a used one on the corner for $350. But that will take me months to save up. ": "surprise", "Time goes by so fast. You'll see. ": "sadness", "Yeah, or I could buy more scratch offs at the gas station and hit it big. ": "anger", "LOL, well there is always luck!": "fear", "I am in the process of potty training my daughter, but when we go somewhere she still wears a diaper. The other day, we were at church and she took her diaper off in the middle of the service.": "disgusted", "I remember those potty training days!!!    I bet you were so embarrassed.": "sadness", "It was not one of our best moments. Luckily, she was wearing and long dress and I had extra diapers so we could remedy the situation.": "sadness", "THank goodness you had extra supplies on hand.   My son was the hardest one out of my 3 kids to potty train.   I feel your pain!!": "joy", "I ordered a new toy for my son online for his birthday.": "anticipation", "Oh, did you give it to him yet?": "sadness", "No, not yet. But, I can't wait to!

I had to take him to the hospital.": "sadness", "Is he okay now?": "sadness", "Even though I'm a christian and I serve God to the best of my abilities, I have been in a rut lately. Last week, during revival, for the first few nights, everyone was praising and participating in worship and just really feeling the Spirit, but I couldn't for whatever reason, and it made me feel bad.": "joy", "Oh, I know what you mean. I have felt that way. Best thing to do is pray about it and don't be hard on yourself.": "sadness", "Yes, I prayed about it multiple times, and by the last night, I was able to feel the Spirit move and I was able to praise and worship too. It felt amazing and it carried over into both services on Sunday too.": "joy", "That's amazing! I'm so happy your prayers were answered. God knows your heart.": "trust", "Thank you. He is all knowing and I'm just so thankful that he cares about me.": "trust", "Sometimes I wake up at night and eat junk food.": "sadness", "I've never done that but i know plenty of people who do that.

What were you getting?": "sadness", "Just some random food stuffs. It wouldn't have been so bad but there was only one cashier.": "sadness", "That's always the case! So annoying.

Did you say anything?": "joy", "No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.": "sadness", "That might be for the best.  Were they arguing about her color or something else?": "sadness", "No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.": "anger", "Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.": "anger", "I dont get to see my only niece too often. I was supposed to babysit her recently, but it fell through. I was kinda sad I didnt get to see her.": "sadness", "I'm sorry you don't get to see her much. I don't see mine often either.

Glad you are ok though! :)": "fear", "My husband's grandfather recently passed away, and his three sons are acting very childish and selfish about everything concerning the will.": "sadness", "Oh no! that's no bueno. Usually the person that wants the least deserves the most. Thats sad": "disgusted", "It really is.

": "joy", "It's always amazing how quickly kids pick up on new skills.": "surprise", "It broke my heart today when I went to the grocery store and found out that they were out of Dean's French Onion Dip.": "sadness", "You must really love that dip to have that much of a reaction to the loss of it.": "sadness", "I do!  I've loved that particular brand for years - to me it's the best out there.  But I guess there's quite a few people out there besides me that have a real love for it!": "joy", "I would assume so, since there has to be someone out there who robbed you of your oniony gold!": "sadness", "Oniony gold!  That's a very apt description!": "sadness", "I'm glad I stuck my job out as long as I did - I finally got offered a promotion today.": "joy", "Congrats! is it a good promotion?": "joy", "It is!  I'll actually be the manager of the entire office, and not just the one section I was in!": "surprise", "Wow that is super exciting. Not many people get that opportunity.

You're right, you did what you could. ": "sadness", "Last week, they arrested 9 people for animal cruelty at a nearby farm and the place was littered with dead and sick and dying animals that they weren't taking care of.": "disgusted", "That's horrible news!  I don't understand how people can be so cruel sometimes.": "anger", "I have a hard enough time understanding man's inhumanity towards their fellow man, but towards animals who can't do much to defend themselves?  I hope they put those people *under* the jail!": "anger", "I know in some places, the penalty for hurting an animal can be tougher than that for hurting your kids.  Nothing makes sense sometimes.

": "disgusted", "Oh goodness, glad you got through is safe lol": "trust", "They arrested 9 people at a nearby farm for animal cruelty and they are already out of jail on bond!": "disgusted", "Oh, that's not right. I have a rescue dog, she had a litter of puppies at a puppy mill before she was a year. ": "disgusted", "Wow!  It makes me sad how people can be so cruel to animals that don't have the ability to fight back.  The rescue shelters here have been working overtime to get things straightened out at that farm.": "sadness", "I could chat with you all day! We have a lot in common- I feel the same way. Keep chatting? Poor rescue animals. ": "sadness", "Yeah.  But I'm glad at least here we have enough agencies [and people volunteering their time] that hopefully, those animals can find good care and good homes.": "trust", "That's great! So sad for those poor animals.

I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the, \"Mom, you always watch this!\" comment!": "joy", "That sounds seriously like a dream. I cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school.": "joy", "How old are they?": "sadness", "4 and 1. I have a bit to go haha.": "joy", "Enjoy them now!  Mine are 17, 15, and 10 and too cool for *everything*.

Dogs are very loyal creatures but can cause a lot of harm": "trust", "The little kitten I rescued last Friday passed away.": "trust", "That is very heartbreaking. How did you find the kitten?": "sadness", "She was under my house, crying.  Her mother had apparently abandoned her.  I called my friend who said she was dehydrated and we did what we could, but her motor functions quit and she passed away in her sleep.": "sadness", "Very sad to hear. You have a good heart and are very caring, that is something to atleast be proud of!": "sadness", "And that kitten knew she was loved.

A few days later she was playing no problem!": "sadness", "Kids pick those things up quickly.  And it'll help with her hand-eye coordination, reading - all sorts of things!

Back when the only buttons on a controller were Start, Select, A and B!": "joy", "I thought I had paid all my daughter's band fees only to find out that I'm 10 dollars short.": "trust", "Oh no! Hopefully you are able to get it sorted out. It's hard to keep up with all the fees for kids schooling.": "sadness", "I keep all my receipts - I learned that lesson her 9th grade year.  I just hate having to make the trip over to the high school because it's in the opposite direction of where I do everything else!": "joy", "Sounds like a headache, i know the feeling.

How long had your cat been with you?": "sadness", "I had him for 17 years, he lived a full and happy life, but I was not ready for him to go.": "joy", "It's always hard to go through that. That's why I'm wary of having any pets": "trust", "But they make your life so much enjoyable while they are around!": "joy", "I went to do karaoke with a guy i'm dating and I discovered he's a really talented singer": "sadness", "Does he like to sing?": "joy", "He's kind of shy about it.

He's an international student and only has a permit.": "trust", "Wow you are very trusting, I do not think I would allow a friend to borrow my car. Is it legal for him to drive with just a permit?

He just wanted to practice driving and he didn't have his own car.": "anger", "Oh okay I see, I thought you actually lent him your car and let him drive around town with it by himself!

I ask him if there is anything that we can work on to make the relationship better.": "trust", "okey no problem": "disgusted", "I don't want to have problems. This is why I check in with him.": "sadness", "For mine too. That was also i said.": "trust", "When I go out with friends I really have to be tight with my money. Times are really hard for me financially?": "trust", "I understand completely. One has to live within one's budget. It can be hard though.": "sadness", "I like go out but I have to really make sure that I don't spend too much.

Too bad you can't leave a tip every time.": "sadness", "I find it appalling how my husband's family is acting now that his grandfather has passed away.": "sadness", "Wow !

I know that time heals.": "sadness", "Yes, it does. ": "trust", "My children are getting old. They are starting to spread the wings.

Labor is a really terrifying thing, especially when something like that happens. Did everything turn out okay?": "fear", "Yes, everything turned out fine. She is a healthy and happy three year old. It was the scariest day of my life though.": "fear", "I can imagine. When I was in the hospital with my 3 year old they lost all his vitals as well.

You need to build a good relationship with your new co-workers.": "trust", "I am trying to quit drinking soda and I have prayed to God and asked Him to help me.

I'm hoping something rewarding comes your way.": "joy", "When I went to the store the other day, I seen a guy all tweaked out on drugs.": "surprise", "Oh geez, thats not good.  Was he bothering anyone?": "sadness", "No, but he seemed a little unpredictable, so I used the other door.": "fear", "I dont blame you.  I probably would have done the same thing.": "sadness", "Holding each of my children for the first time was amazing.": "joy", "I remember that feeling with my daughter, it is indescribable.": "joy", "Yes!! I can't think of any thing else that produces feelings like that.": "joy", "There is nothing to compare it to. I wish I hadn't been waking from anesthesia in that moment so I could have been more awake. ": "fear", "I forgot about my grandmother's birthday a couple years back. I felt so bad about it!": "sadness", "Oh no! It happens to the best of us :) Have you talked to her about it when you remembered?": "sadness", "Absolutely! I called her the next day and made sure to visit her. :)": "sadness", "Awww I'm sure she completely understood and really appreciated you reaching out and going to visit her!": "sadness", "She did. :) It ended up being a good visit anyway!": "joy", "I was digging around in some of my old stuff at my dads the other day, and I found all my old paintball gear.": "sadness", "Oh, how cool! Dd you and your dad play together?": "joy", "No, just me. But, I am going to go play this weekend at a place up the road. It's been years since I've played.": "joy", "That's great. It'll be wonderful to relive those happy moments in the present maybe with your family.": "sadness", "I went skydiving last summer with my partner. It was so scary!": "fear", "Wow, that is scary. Were you nervous?": "fear", "Absolutely! I've always been scared of heights, but I'm so glad I made myself.": "joy", "It sounds like a great experience!": "joy", "When I was a kid, I had a dog at my grandpa's. He gave it away because it wouldn't hunt.": "sadness", "How did you feel when he gave it away? ": "sadness", "I was very upset. I was only like nine at the time so I took it really hard.": "sadness", "Yeah I would have been too. As a nine year old kid that's hard to deal with. ": "sadness", "I tripped and fell in front of some people.": "sadness", "Ouch! Was it a serious fall?": "sadness", "No, only my pride was injured.": "sadness", "That's a relatively quick recovery, fortunately. ": "fear", "I recently dug up a necklace my grandmother gave me when I was young for a birthday. I hadn't seen it in years.": "sadness", "Oh my.. that must have been very sad. I can't even imagine how you must have felt. ": "sadness", "Yeah, she passed more than five years ago and I had forgotten all about it. It brought back so many memories though!": "sadness", "I'm so sorry.! But I'm really glad you've got those pleasant memories and the memento to hold on to so you can remember her fondly. ": "sadness", "I just won an award for best yard in the neighborhood! ": "joy", "Wow that's great, you must have put a lot of work into your yard.": "joy", "I did, mowed it three times a week and watered it twice a day. All the hard work really paid off. ": "joy", "Cool, I guess the grass is actually greener in your yard now!": "joy", "It is, it really stands out from all the brown grass in my neighbors yards.": "joy", "I get to go to the park today for a BBQ with friends, it should be so much fun!": "joy", "Ooh nice. That does sound like alot of fun. Do you guys play any sport while your there? ": "joy", "We often throw around a frisbee for a little bit, but we never get too intense with any sports. ": "fear", "Cool. Well enjoy, I hope the weather hold up.": "joy", "Me too, there has been a lot of rain lately. It should be fun hanging out with old friends!": "sadness", "Yeah, I haven't seen my friends in forever. We don't even live in the same state anymore.": "sadness", "I snuck some candy out of my daughter's snack stash. I feel bad because I had been trying to diet.": "sadness", "I understand that feeling. I've had trouble letting go of those kind of cravings too. Has your diet been going well otherwise?": "sadness", "Otherwise it's been pretty good- I've managed to lose 12 pounds! Just wish I could let the sugar cravings go.": "sadness", "Wow, congratulations! Sugar is one of the hardest things to kick, I don't have the knack for it either, but still you're making great progress!": "joy", "My childhood friend gave me a watch for by birthday a few years ago, I lost it in a move recently. I'm pretty upset by it.": "sadness", "Oh no!  It always seems like things get lost when you move doesn't it?  Is there anyway you can go back and see if its at your old place?": "sadness", "I've actually checked and went through all the boxes too. Here's hoping it turns up one day though!": "surprise", "It will probably be where you least expect it!": "surprise", "I let my daughter ride in the road by herself on her skateboard the other day.": "surprise", "Oh wow.  How did she do?": "joy", "She did great. She's pretty good about looking out for cars.": "surprise", "That's awesome!  That's great exercise! ": "joy", "It is so upsetting that my daughter was in a car accident. I am thankful that she was fine but we lost our car because of someone's bad judgment.": "trust", "Oh, no! That's so terrible!": "sadness", "It was. They wanted to blame my daughter but it was their fault.": "anger", "I'm so sorry that happened! I'm glad she's okay, though.": "sadness", "I was feeling really down for a few weeks and my sister knew. She drove hours to come see me and make me feel better!": "sadness", "That is a great sister. I'm sorry you were feeling down": "sadness", "Yeah it was really sweet of her and made me feel so much better!": "trust", "I am glad you are feeling better now": "sadness", "I was recently on a long international flight and we hit some really bad turbulence.": "fear", "That must've been scary! Did you freak out?": "fear", "I didn't, but I was really nervous for a little while. My wife didn't handle it quite as well.": "fear", "Oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. At least you both survived the flight. ": "sadness", "For sure. And it was a great trip.": "joy", "I screwed up plans for a date night with my wife. We ended up having to cancel and she was really mad about it.": "sadness", "Oh I bet you were pretty upset. Did you guys reschedule?": "anger", "We did and I made sure to not screw that one up!": "sadness", "Haha good! I'm glad that one went well.": "joy", "Me too. Who knows what would have happened to me if I did it twice.": "sadness", "I was able to go back home to my parents for a few weeks recently. It was wonderful to relax in my childhood home.": "joy", "It's always nice to visit home. Did your parents enjoy your visit?": "joy", "They loved having me around again! Our ten year old dog wouldn't leave my side.": "sadness", "Ha ha! I bet. Dogs are the best. I bet he missed you just as much as they did.": "sadness", "I've been thinking about buying some new, softer skateboard wheels.": "anticipation", "What makes you want to get softer wheels? Are those harder to skateboard on?": "joy", "No, they make rough pavement feel smoother. I think I'll just keep the ones I have for now though. Just have to deal with having a rough ride.": "sadness", "I didn't know that about softer wheels! Maybe in the future you can change to those.": "joy", "I took my dog I've had for years over to meet one of my husband's sisters the other night.": "sadness", "Oh neat!  How did the little one handle it?": "surprise", "It did not go well at all! She pooped all over the carpet and she never has accidents at home.": "anger", "Oh no!  Poor baby must have been really stressed out. ": "sadness", "Yeah, I think it might've been too much on her at once. I was pretty embarrassed.": "sadness", "I had to take my daughter to the doctor the other day. She was very sick.": "trust", "Oh no!  Hopefully its just the flu.  What did they say?": "sadness", "It was just the flu. I got her some medicine, brought her home, and made tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches.": "trust", "That's good!  I hope she gets to feeling better soon.  The flu is no fun.": "trust", "So my sister is getting married in a few weeks.": "joy", "Congratulations! I bet she is excited and hopefully you are excited for her. ": "joy", "Absolutely! The whole family is flying out, we can barely contain ourselves.": "joy", "Oooo!!! That is so awesome! Will you be in her wedding party?": "surprise", "So my friend adopted a new kitten very recently.": "trust", "I love kitten, but I can't have one where I live. I bet it is so cute": "trust", "Oh, she is absolutely adorable! I'm so envious, I haven't been able to adopt one yet.": "anger", "Do you plan on getting one": "joy", "Bought a new car a few months back. Couple nights ago we had a big storm roll through. I thought for sure it was going to hail all over my new car.": "fear", "oh man. i hate that. we've had some pretty nasty storms come through Austin in the last few months and luckily i've managed to be in some random parking garage out shopping or eating when they've rolled through.": "joy", "Nice! We have a garage, but my wife takes up what little room isnt filled with junk with her car. Mine wouldnt fit anyway unless I cleared it out.": "joy", "lol. well that's no good. cleaning garages bites. ": "disgusted", "I do programming work and I recently had a question I had to run by a co-worker. He is a programming wizard. He easily handled my issue and was using terms and methods I had never even heard of.": "surprise", "i guess in your field of work you would run across terms and methods which are unfamiliar": "sadness", "That is true. I usually can keep up, but this guy is on another level. ": "anger", "you'll find some like that, not much you can do": "sadness", "I had a meeting with my bosses the other day to discuss finally getting a promotion.": "joy", "How long did it take you to get your promotion?": "joy", "I've been working there for a couple years now. I'm feeling pretty good about my chances! Haven't heard back yet.": "joy", "I bet that your bosses will give you the long over promotion. I will keep my fingers crossed for you. Good luck!": "anticipation", "I feel so good about knowing I am going to win the race on Sunday. The race is for my favorite charity.

They will be there to cheer me on! ": "trust", "I bet it will feel amazing to have them cheering you on! I have a feeling you'll do great in your race.": "joy", "My wife has had a trip in mind ever since I've known her. She recently had a big birthday so I surprised her with the trip. We went and she loved it. It made me happy to see her so happy.": "surprise", "That's wonderful! Where are you guys going to go?": "joy", "It was just a trip to the west coast. There was a handful of things she's always wanted to see/do. So we did all of them.": "joy", "I'm glad you guys had a good time. Are you planning another trip?": "joy", "Not yet. We try to take one big trip a year if possible. We just got back from that one, so we will start plotting out next year a little later I would imagine.": "anticipation", "I live in Florida. When I go home once a year it is a grand occasion.": "joy", "Where is it that you go to go home? ": "joy", "I grew up in Alabama. It is not far from Florida but still I get so thrill when I can go back to see family and friends.": "sadness", "That's awesome. I love going back to my hometown to visit as well. It's nice to see family you don't see every day.": "joy", "My sons first day of school was the other day.": "sadness", "wow. like, very first? or just the start of the year?": "joy", "Very first. I was so nervous till he got off the bus.": "fear", "how did he like it? how did you do?": "surprise", "I have a test coming up that I've been studying for weeks for.": "joy", "Oh boy!!   WHat is the test over?    ": "joy", "It's a Japanese language test for college.

Good luck on your test, Im sure you will do fine.": "fear", "I had phone interview for a job. It went very well": "joy", "great, i hope you get the job.": "joy", "Thank you. I wrote down a list of questions and key points beforehand.": "joy", "so you were really prepared. ": "joy", "I saw an old movie. It reminded me of my younger days.": "sadness", "That's cool, good movies have a way of tapping into those feelings.": "fear", "Yes. It's almost like a time machine. Fond memories.": "sadness", "Sometimes it almost makes me want to go back somehow. But it's also important to move forward.": "sadness", "I lost my job because my company didn't pay rent at our location.": "sadness", "oh that is so wrong. How are you handling it?": "sadness", "Not very well. It makes me so angry. So I go work out to relieve the stress.": "anger", "that's good you do that, I would be very frustrated too. That's really unfair. Can you pursue legal charges?": "anger", "Recently my wife left me home alone with the dog all weekend while she was gone on a girls trip.": "sadness", "Oh I bet that was fun. What kind of dog do you have?": "joy", "I missed her while she was gone. We have a mixed breed rescue pup.": "trust", "My husband was gone all weekend buying us a new puppy, so I understand feeling lonely! ": "sadness", "Our computer system at work is goofing up a lot, but the development team just keeps saying there's nothing wrong.": "anger", "Ugh, I bet that is really frustrating. Is it making it difficult to do your job?": "anger", "Sometimes. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just slows me down and takes longer than it should to do the things I need to do.": "sadness", "That makes for long days at work. I hope they can fix it for you soon.": "anger", "Every time my kids go to grandma's they get to eat all kinds of candies, and get new toys.": "sadness", "Omg, I bet they come home so spoiled.": "trust", "Yeah they do! Some times I wish I got to go visit grandma's like they do lol.": "sadness", "Yeah, what the heck I don't remember my mom being so nice when I was a kid! lol": "sadness", "I was really happy when my nephew was born, Sadly i was informed he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease.": "joy", "That's sad to hear. What's his prognosis?": "sadness", "He's doing about as well as he can be. Very healthy, but without some new discoveries he will likely have a shortened lifespan.": "sadness", "Hopefully medical technology will catch up to where it needs to be for him. ": "anger", "I bought some cheap stocks hoping that they would go up in price. They didn't.": "anticipation", "Oh no! I used to be a financial advisor so I'm sure that was frustrating. I hope you didn't lose too much money!": "sadness", "Not too much. I only put in what I could afford to lose.": "anger", "As much as I hate they didn't go up in price for you, I'm so happy that you didn't overdo it.": "sadness", "I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasnt done that in ages.": "sadness", "Oh yuck! I'm sorry that that happened. What kind of dog is he? Is he sick?": "disgusted", "Thanks. I dont think so. He has seemed fine otherwise. I've watched him on our security cam today and he seems fine. He is a mutt from a local shelter.": "trust", "Hopefully it was just a bad day for him and he won't do it again! I have a couple rescue mutts as well. ": "joy", "Yeah. I love that goofy animal.  Hope he's ok": "trust", "I work for a software company. I have been trying to learn a new language for some stuff. I knocked out my first task like a champ.": "joy", "That's great!

She hasn't had to learn anything new for decades.": "surprise", "Yeah i get that. I work for a startup so things change pretty rapidly around here.": "sadness", "I landed an ollie on my skateboard for the first time in 14 years yesterday.": "sadness", "holy moly thats great i cant ever walk normal": "sadness", "Yeah it took a lot of practice.": "fear", "oh i bet": "sadness", "Next week I am off work and going to the beach.": "joy", "That is wonderful! So you will be on a vacation? Will you be going alone? ": "joy", "No I am going with my wife and her family. But we all get along great so it should be fun.": "joy", "You will be having fun in the sun. Nothing like a day at beach.": "joy", "Amen. It is much needed. Ready for some sun and a drink with an umbrella.": "joy", "Yea, once I vacationed on a Caribbean island, Lovely beaches, food and drinks.": "joy", "Not too long ago, I took a trip on a plane. The airline lost my whole suitcase!": "anger", "Oh man! how long did it take to get your stuff back?": "sadness", "The whole vacation! I was so upset!

Do you guys talk often?": "trust", "It was more about just some personal life stuff. Not too much really.": "sadness", "I came back from a trip recently, got called in the boss's office and was given a decent sized raise.": "joy", "Ooh, very nice suprize!": "surprise", "Absolutely. I certainly won't say no to that.": "sadness", "Keep up the good work, whatever your doing.": "joy", "Budget is kind of tight lately and I am really afraid my wife's aging car is about to bite the dust.": "fear", "Oh dear. I am so sorry to hear. It is possible for you to get a second job?": "sadness", "I may have to if that happens. We are making it now, but if the car goes it will be pretty tough.": "fear", "i can just imagine. I wish There was something that I could do to help.": "sadness", "It is ok. We are probably too proud to take help anyway. We will make it.": "sadness", "I pray and hope that something works out and that the good old faithful car will not bite the dust.": "trust", "So I recently went through some old boxes and found some of my childhood dolls. It brought back a lot of memories!": "sadness", "That is always a fun thing to do! I hope the memories were all good!": "sadness", "Absolutely!

What happened to your laptop? if you get a new one which one are you looking at?": "anger", "My daughter tripped on the cord and it smashed on the ground, not sure if it can be saved.

I think you'll be fine, maybe you were just extra tired.": "sadness", "My Uncle Jebodiah is always looking out for me. He recently told me that he had a special concoction that if I drank it, it would cure my herpes.": "anger", "Lol! I don't think i would trust that concoction if i were you.": "fear", "Listen, my Uncle Jeb wouldn't do me dirty like that.

It felt dangerous!": "fear", "that is dangerous, glad that both of your are okay": "fear", "Look, can we just be honest with each other for a second?

Lame.": "anger", "Now that is interesting, I wish you the best of luck.": "joy", "I am obsessive about being ready for anything": "joy", "Oh really?

And I once almost got my finger bit off by a snapping turtle, it wasn't a pleasant experience so I couldn't imagine hers. You are great for staying there.": "sadness", "It was swallowed whole, unfortunately. I just hope the shark seasoned it properly. I won't stand for underprepared human thigh meat.

My girlfriend, who is the smartest person I know, has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much. She's so forgetful because she's so efficient and on top of everything else important, that sometimes she misses the small things. Maybe that's true in your case, too!": "anger", "That's pretty funny, and makes me feel better. This is the first time I've lost my keys so I hope to keep it that way!": "sadness", "I've heard some people place theirs in a bowl near the front door as soon as they come home, or they stick it in the fridge with their lunch.. silly things to make sure they can keep it together.": "anger", "I came home the other day and my roommate had a friend over. I've only seen him with a friend over once in my 3.5 years of living here.": "trust", "Wow. That must be a very special friend. I net you were surprised.": "surprise", "Yeah I sure was, he seems to like this one much better than the last one he had over. He couldn't wait for that first guy to leave.": "sadness", "Oh dear.

It seemed suspicious so I pretty much told her I didn't know any of the answers to her questions. I don't think she likes my supervisor.": "fear", "oh that's just a recipe for disaster 100% of the time.": "joy", "Yeah I figured it was, so I just played dumb and let my supervisor know. My supervisor has always been good to me.": "trust", "mine has too. i think you did the right thing by not getting involved.": "anger", "Man there aren't many people I would give my last couple hundred dollars to, with one notable exception.": "surprise", "Hm, who might that be?

She made such a big scene that I got on to make her stop.": "sadness", "Oh no, did you get hurt?": "sadness", "Yes, the horse took off running and I got thrown into a metal fence. My mother then proceeded to yell and me and make fun of me for trusting her. She told me that I should never trust anyone not even my own parents, it was really embarrassing to get yelled at in from my friend. Afterwards my ribs hurt for 2 months.   ": "sadness", "Yikes, I'm sorry to hear that.  That sounds horrifying!": "sadness", "My friend really wanted me to go rollerblading with him, but I haven't been rollerblading since I was a little kid. I didn't want to roll into a car.": "fear", "So what did you do?": "sadness", "We went, but it was still pretty terrible because I felt completely uncomfortable and was bent over the whole time ready to catch myself.": "sadness", "Well, I bet your friend had a good time with you being there. Sometimes we have to make sacrefices for those we care about.": "sadness", "My husband is on the road a lot, I hardley ever see him.": "sadness", "I'm sorry.

I have been trying to adapt to enjoying alone time.": "sadness", "I'm sorry you feel lonely.  My wife says she ofens feels the same way.  I know your husband misses you awfully while he's away.

Did you see what happened to the dog?!": "sadness", "It was pretty tramatic, I still see the dog getting hit in my head and the sound. No, I was on my way to work, I couldn't stop :(": "fear", "That's so sad! What on earth is a dog doing around a highway?! That just breaks my heart.. ": "sadness", "I can't even begin to tell you how nervous I was about my first tattoo.": "fear", "I can understand the anxiety. Its a whole new different experience for first timers!": "fear", "Definitely! I get lightheaded when I see my own blood, and my pain threshold was low at the time.

": "joy", "Who can deny it? My dad passed away 2 years ago. Sometimes I put on his old records and imagine what it would have been like to hang out with him in the 70s.": "sadness", "Yeah he sounds amazing.  Sorry for your loss friend :(": "sadness", "I was feeling kind of down so I ended up snuggling with a stuffed rabbit I have. It brought back a lot of good old memories. ": "sadness", "Never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal. My mom said I used to carry this blanket with me when I was a toddler, everywhere I went. I wish I still had it. If I did, I'd consider using it again, or at the very least passing it down to my own kid. What's the harm, you know? If something gives you comfort and doesn't bother anyone else, there should be no shame.": "sadness", "Awe yeah thanks. He's pretty soft even though he some derpy eye that point in opposite directions. Brings me a lot of comfort and reminds me that someone cares.": "sadness", "Well, if I were you, I'd keep it up, whether or not my spouse laughed at me, or a new girlfriend/boyfriend, whatever. It's not childish to me. Life is stressful enough. Let us snuggle what we want.": "sadness", "Aw! That's horrible, I'm sorry to hear that.": "sadness", "He did not live. I've never felt so sad before.": "sadness", "That's so sad, I don't even know what to say!": "sadness", "Some random guy was in my backyard, I didn't realize before I looked outside that I was missing pants.": "sadness", "Oh no! That is really creepy, why is he in your backyard?": "fear", "Turns out he was the cable guy fixing a wire. Still mad he didn't ask permisson first. ": "anger", "Yeah, that's illegal I think, they need to at least knock or ring the door bell!": "joy", "My family is still hasn't recovered from the untimely passing of my father two years ago.": "sadness", "I am so sorry to hear that. It can't be easy for you and your family.": "sadness", "My siblings and I are managing, and have found some peace. My mother is a different story.

Time to sleep in and binge watch my favorite shows.": "joy", "What shows are your favorite? That must be nice.": "joy", "I like It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. I'm rewatching it for the third time": "joy", "Must be nice, got any nice snacks?": "joy", "I was really stressed out and grad school and had no choice but to drop out to keep my sanity.": "trust", "Good choice. You're health is more important than some grad degree. ": "joy", "That is what I was thinking at the time, but I've been having a really tough time finding a job where I can advance into a higher position. I always seem to get positions with no mobility.": "fear", "I think nowadays employers just want experience. So it should be easier once you have that. ": "fear", "I tripped on some steps in front of a whole bunch of people on my way to class.": "sadness", "Ah, I hate when that happens!

Ate at my cube ever since I don't even want to make eye contact with anyone.": "sadness", "I am sure it was not as bad as you think. ": "sadness", "I have a really big meeting next week. I have rehearsed what I am to go over all this past week and plan to practice a little more this weekend. ": "joy", "Wow! What kind of meeting is it?": "joy", "It's a meeting presenting a new product to the board. Big stuff and big money for the company.": "joy", "Dang! I hope you have successful meeting then!": "joy", "Oh no, was it romantic texts?": "sadness", "It was definitely a bit flirty. I think he misses being with her": "trust", "That's sad. I hope you are OK.": "sadness", "I know I broke up with my ex, but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.": "anger", "That must be weird to talk to your ex still.": "anger", "We actually get along really well and are much better friends than a couple.

Makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff.": "trust", "She likes to bake, so we take them what she makes :)": "surprise", "That sounds cool!  I bet she cooks good!": "surprise", "She is pretty good for an eleven year old, better than I was.": "joy", "haha same here!  ": "sadness", "I had a secret and went to my mother to confide in her, as well as get off my chest. I know she would never betray my secret and can always count on her.": "trust", "I am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely.": "trust", "Yes, I sure do! There aren't many people you can feel that way with and I am so grateful!": "trust", "Hopefully she knows how much this means to you.": "sadness", "My son applied to a prestigious college and the wait killed us.

It's so good to get some time away from the hustle and bustle of life!": "joy", "i know! i am sure you were able to recharge your batteries ": "joy", "I am looking forward to next week! My husband has been out of town on business for several weeks and comes home next weekend!": "joy", "Do you have any special welcome-back events planned?": "joy", "I am going to cook a special meal and see if he wants to go out, just us two. I know he will like that.": "joy", "That sounds great. Does he travel often?": "surprise", "My husband has been out of town a few weeks for work but is coming back next weekend. I have a surprise night planned for just us. I am optimistic and sure he will really enjoy it.": "anticipation", "How exciting! I hope everything goes as planned!": "joy", "Thanks! We've been married almost 23 years but I try to keep things fun and spend time together.": "joy", "Sounds like you have a good relationship. I hope when I get married it turns out just as good.": "trust", "My son went back to college recently and it had me feeling a bit nostalgic. I could just picture him starting Kindergarten and it seemed not so long ago!": "sadness", "aww. im sure you must feel proud of him": "joy", "Yes, very. But, time sure has flown by with him growing up. I can just see his little blonde head when he was 5 and just starting school!": "joy", "that sounds so cute": "joy", "I was promoted to a Team Leader and I felt very secure I could do well at the job. I had years of experience and was ready for a leadership role.": "joy", "that is good news. its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead": "joy", "Yes, thank you! I had worked very hard through the years, and I felt that I earned it, and would do well at it.": "joy", "i hope you do well and excell": "joy", "There was an incident where one of my back neighbors called my young son a name and made fun of him. I was so mad, beyond angry!": "anger", "An adult did this? ": "anger", "Yes, and she had two children of her own, similar in age. Her son also weighed more than mine! She did it because my son rode his bike through the corner of her yard as rode around the circle, that made her mad! Can you believe that??": "surprise", "I dont get people sometimes. Who does that that sort of thing.": "sadness", "Last week my granddaughter started school for the first time. I worried about her the entire day.": "fear", "Aww, they grow up so fast!!  How did she do?": "sadness", "It turns out she loves and and I was a mess for 8 hours for nothing. ": "sadness", "haha, I'm sorry you were so upset for nothing!  But it's so great that she loves school.  I hope she loves learning her whole life.": "joy", "I always try and plan everything in advance to bring everything we need when we go on vacation. We recently went on our honeymoon and I didn't do very well this time. Ugh!": "sadness", "What went wrong?": "sadness", "I forgot everything. I guess I was so excited about the wedding, I totally failed at packing this time. Oh well, it was still fun.": "sadness", "That is all that matters, its about the love.": "joy", "One day I was visiting a friend and her boyfriend came up and kissed me, while I was waiting for my friend to return from another room! It was sneaky and repulsed me!": "anger", "I understand. Did you told your friend?": "sadness", "I didn't....only because of her situation. She had custody of her very ill and handicapped infant grandson, she wasn't working so depended on him financially and she was very much in love with him. She already suspected he was with other women, and stayed.....": "trust", "Wow, it is terrible.": "sadness", "The other night I was home alone and all of a sudden I heard someone knocking at the door really loud and they wouldn't stop. I was so scared.": "fear", "Did you go see who it was?": "sadness", "No, I ignored them and they finally went away. I was just about to call the police before they left though. I hope that doesn't happen again.": "sadness", "No that's scary stuff.": "fear", "I was trying to ignore the fact that my 50th birthday was coming up but my family decided to throw me a surprise party.": "surprise", "That is great. What is it fun?": "joy", "It was so much fun and such a happy night. I'm trying to embrace my age now and not ignore it any more": "joy", "That is always difficult.": "sadness", "A few weeks ago, my husband and I had a big argument. I said some pretty hurtful things, and wished I hadn't. I felt very bad and disappointed in myself afterwards.": "sadness", "I am single and never been married. I assume arguments are part of marriage.": "sadness", "Yes, that's true. I tend to be a bit more verbal on my end and say things I regret later. ": "sadness", "Im bad at giving advice especially to people I dont know. Im the opposite. Im too mellow. And that sometimes gets me in trouble.": "anger", "One night when my kids and I came home, I saw a shadow in my hallway as I came in the back door. I was so scared and was afraid someone had broken in my home.": "fear", "In some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house.": "fear", "Yes, and I live out in the country so I wouldn't get a quick response time from emergency vehicles. But, luckily, it turned out to be my shadow!": "fear", "I hope you aren't still scared of your shadow?": "fear", "There was a day that I was a bit short on cash on hand and I didn't give money to a homeless man. I usually always do, as I feel it's my part to help those in need, as I am blessed. I felt very bad that I didn't that day.": "sadness", "I don't think you should feel too bad about missing one day!  It sounds like you're generous regularly.  I get it though.": "joy", "Well, homeless people aren't common in my area, so that's why I felt a bit bad about it. ": "sadness", "It's hard to see people and not be able to help.  You seem really giving!": "trust", "When my children were born, it was a rejoicing time for me. I can't think of a time I felt more happiness.": "joy", "Children are a beautiful thing for us parents. What a great memory you have of that. ": "sadness", "Yes, I have two children and I feel so blessed to have them. I lucked out and got a boy and girl, both healthy, smart and wonderful.": "joy", "Thats perfect, a boy and a girl thats what most people want. congrats. ": "joy", "I used to work in a place where all my colleagues had different believes to myself. I wanted to stay true to what I believed in, so had to walk away from conversations on many occasions.": "trust", "In what do you believe?": "sadness", "Just that all people should be given an equal chance in life and that no one type of person is better than another, just because of their religion or skin color, or where they come from.": "anger", "That is great. In what do your colleagues believe?": "joy", "They believed that people of their religion where better than everyone else and were going to heaven, while the rest of us are left at the gate! That's one of their beliefs anyway. I don't agree with that, but chose to keep my mouth shut!": "anger", "I recently bought a new car after not driving for several years and I was really scared to drive it, especially on the highway.": "fear", "What car did you buy?": "surprise", "Just a Honda Civic. People drive crazy around here. I don't want to have another car accident like the last one.": "anger", "Jeez. Where do you live? I dont remember any state Ive been to with bad drivers.": "sadness", "I recently joined a group to help me lose weight. I have so much respect and admire everyone in that group so much.": "joy", "Good luck! My sister-in-law has been with weight watchers for a while now. She loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other.": "joy", "It has really helped to have their support. I am so grateful for them": "trust", "You'll reach your goal. You just have to make small adjustments which'll sustain you throughout your life. How many meetings do you attend?": "fear", "A few years ago I applied for US citizenship. To succeed you have to pass a Civics test. I was so terribly nervous!": "fear", "That test seems so hard. I probably couldn't even pass it. How did you do?": "sadness", "I passed! Turns out you only had to answer three questions correctly. But they have 50 to choose from so you have to study the lot!": "joy", "I didn't know that. Congratulations. That's so awesome.": "joy", "Thank you. My poor husband had to sit every single night and test me. He's American and he didn't think he could pass!": "joy", "I found some old Christmas cards the other day and had a lovely time reading them and reminiscing about the people who sent them.": "sadness", "That must have been nice. I keep cards too.": "trust", "It was so nice. I'm terrible about throwing cards out. I feel, if someone's taken the time to write, I should preserve it. Does that sound silly?": "sadness", "Of course not. There is so much paper in this house. I keep cards, photos, school projects. Everything. We arent here forever": "sadness", "That's very true. My Dad kept everything too. When he passed we had quite a task sorting through things. I think my brother's still at it!": "anger", "I found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed. I think they passed down their hoarding to us lol": "sadness", "I believe you are right! My family are going to go nuts when they see what they've got to deal with, lol.": "sadness", "Lol. Me too!!": "joy", "When I was entering the store it was really slippery.": "fear", "Why was it slippery": "fear", "It had been raining , so I ran across the parking lot in to the store. I slid about 3 feet.": "fear", "Oh no, were you okay": "sadness", "I was fine, just felt like every one was looking at me.": "sadness", "I am feeling a bit guilty about keeping a secret for my friend.": "sadness", "Oh no. Why are you keeping the secret?": "sadness", "I don't want to out her to her husband, usually the only thing that happens is they drop the friend.": "sadness", "Oh it sounds like you are in a difficult situation. I hope you can get out of the middle of it!": "fear", "Thanks, I am just going to avoid them until it plays iteself out.": "sadness", "I feel kind of blue today, they announced the parts for the annual play.": "surprise", "Oh I am sorry. Did you get any part?": "sadness", "I did, and it is a good one, just not the one that I wanted. I didn't want the lead or anything.": "sadness", "I am glad you got a good part. I am sure it is a let down to not get what you were hoping for though.": "trust", "It is, my friend got it, or I wouldn't think about it so much. Thanks for the kind words though.": "sadness", "I'm teaching my daughter how to drive, and so far, so good!": "joy", "That is wonderful, I imagine she is very excited.": "joy", "She is!  At first, though, she was very nervous.  I told her we could start off slow - her dad lives 1 mile from me down a quiet road, so we started driving back and forth between the two houses.": "fear", "Okay i see well, take your time she will be getting her liscense soon": "sadness", "Hopefully by the first of the year.  We've worked up to driving to the dollar store 5 miles away.  She's still a little nervous but she's getting better and more confident the more we practice.": "joy", "She just needs to get her confidence and I am sure you are a great teacher.": "joy", "I do what I can where I can.  Can't wait for our hard work to pay off and she gets her license!": "joy", "It will definitely paid off and I am rooting for her.": "joy", "My house is a mess and I've got people coming over later on this evening.": "anger", "That can be overwhelming. Are you going to be cleaning all day then?": "sadness", "I'm going to try to.  If worst comes to worse, I'll just toss everything in my back bedroom, shiny up the floors and hope for the best!  *chuckle*": "sadness", "I'm sure you will get it done!": "joy", "My brother and I recently had to sell a house and he dealt with everything. I'm so lucky to have a brother I can rely on and who I know won't try and con me.": "trust", "Thats neat. Do you guys make a lot of money?": "joy", "We did and he was so precise with who got what and made sure he sent me my share quickly. He's such a neat brother in so many regards. I always know he'll be there for anyone who needs help.": "sadness", "I wish my siblings were like that. We should be more supportive and close like that": "sadness", "We weren't always close. When we were kids we were always fighting. It wasn't until we got older that we got closer. We're best of friends now.": "sadness", "I am jealous lol": "anger", "Don't be! There are many, many types of relationships and I don't think ours is necessarily typical. It's just the way it is :)": "sadness", "I will work on it with my family. ": "sadness", "My son was in advance placement and honors during high school. He went to a prestigious college after, going for as an Aerospace Engineer. He never ceases to astonish me with his intelligence and admire me with how hard he works to pursue his dreams.": "surprise", "Wow!  It sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted!  You must be really proud of him!": "joy", "I am quite proud, thank you! I also have a teenage daughter that is very smart and an amazing artist, (which I don't know where she gets that talent). They really impress me with amazing they are!": "surprise", "Man, that is amazing that both your kids are so talented.  I hope my little ones are like that.  Congrats on your great parenting!": "joy", "Going out today to learn a new route for my job and I'm hoping that I don't get lost.": "anticipation", "Are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it?": "anger", "I got the assignment yesterday, and I told myself that I'd go drive around it today and tomorrow.  My boss is supposed to ride along with me the first week, and then after that I'll be on my own.": "sadness", "Well hopefully you're able to familiarize yourself quickly. Good luck!": "fear", "I was over here in the US when my Grandma passed in Scotland. I was so upset - nobody could get hold of me to tell me and her funeral was over before I knew about it.": "sadness", "Thats sad. Have you been to Scotand since?": "sadness", "Only for funerals, unfortunately. Both my parents have since died. Unpleasant fact of life, I'm afraid.": "fear", "Im sorry to hear that. Were you born there?": "sadness", "Yes I was. I didn't come to the US until I was in my 30s. Didn't expect my Grandma to pass the minute I got here, but she was 96, so it shouldn't have been such a surprise!": "surprise", "96! Wow. Thats a full life!": "joy", "She was as fit as a flea too. She tripped and broke her hip and got a bad infection in the hospital. That's what she died of!": "sadness", "Wow. She probably couldve kept going for years if it wasnt for that.": "sadness", "I just bought an Xbox! I've never owned a gaming console before": "joy", "Excellent! Are you enjoying it?": "joy", "I am! I bought Halo and am ready to ride.": "joy", "Sick. I hope it's as fun as it looks!": "anticipation", "My father passed away 2 years ago, but my mother lives in my neighborhood now. I'm so thankful she lives close by and still here with us. She's such a wonderful mother.": "trust", "I am glad that she is living close to you. That must make you feel special. My mom is dead so I understand how you feel.": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that, I know it's so hard to lose a parent. I think we take them for granted when we are younger, but I am blessed she's still here.": "trust", "I am happy that your mom is still around. Cherish the days that you spend together.": "joy", "I am as happy as a clam right now. My neighbors are away for the weekend!": "joy", "are they typically bad or something?": "fear", "The live upstairs and constantly thump around, screeching into their cellphones. And then there's the video games...": "anger", "Oh that makes sense, well enjoy the peace and quiet!": "sadness", "Oh I am, believe me I am. The world seems like a calm, serene place where everything is just right!": "surprise", "My friend from across the continent came over yesterday! I was so happy about it": "joy", "Thats awesome. What did you guys do?": "joy", "We ended up hanging out and recording some audio. He is a voice actor": "sadness", "that sounds fun!": "joy", "I was out for a walk one night in a suburb of Boston when we heard the cries of a young animal. It was a baby kitten, with no collar, in a window well.": "trust", "Poor thing! What did you do?   Did you take it home with you?": "disgusted", "We actually did, and ended up adopting him. He was still so young he needed formula, but now he is thriving!": "joy", "eww,  that is great you took such great care of him.  ": "trust", "I felt a need to help when the baby bird was by itself": "trust", "That 's nice of you.  Did you keep it as a pet": "trust", "I did not, I was little but I think I put it back into a tree": "sadness", "Cool.  Some birds shouldn't be in captivity.  What kind of bird was it": "trust", "Waiting to see if I would graduate was pretty unnerving": "anticipation", "That is a nerve-racking experience. But I'm betting you did graduate and did just fine!": "fear", "Yep, had to take a class online over the summer but it worked out": "sadness", "Congratulations! Waiting for results can be very stressful - everything's out of your hands and all you can do is wait.": "joy", "I forgot my mother-in-law's birthday this year and can't look her in the eye!": "sadness", "I'm sure she understands, just tell the truth!": "sadness", "I just feel so embarrassed - she never forgets my birthday. And my husband was away and didn't remind me :( ": "sadness", "Yeah, I'd be pretty scared too, but it's better to be upfront about it to get it off your chest": "fear", "You're right. She's a very forgiving person and I've never forgotten before. It's on St. Paddy's day for heavens sake - how could I forget???": "sadness", "I was the only one wearing pajamas at this party, not my greatest moment": "sadness", "Oh boy. Did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress?": "anger", "I thought that it was a pajama party haha, never worn a dress before, maybe that's the secret": "sadness", "Everyone looks good in a dress. Just make sure to shave first.": "joy", "I had some trippy nightmares as a kid, now I don't really have dreams": "fear", "Oh man, I did too.  I still do every once in a while but only when I'm having trouble sleeping.  Does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly?": "sadness", "Yeah, it was like I was tied to a chair and a huge thing was staring at me, pretty weird": "anger", "Creepy! I once had a dream of a Lion laying at the end of my bad. It was scary but also comforting.  I feel like I could've touched it. Glad you're free of those dreams now.": "joy", "I didn't realize that stealing was bad until I realized how it made me feel afterwards": "sadness", "So you probably felt pretty guilty huh. Did you return what you stole?": "sadness", "No, I was scared to get charged, but I stopped after that": "fear", "Glad to hear you stopped with your wayward habits before the Po Po caught up with you!": "sadness", "I was at a meditation retreat last year for 10 days and I can say that I experienced a better feeling there than I could ever remembe": "fear", "I've always liked the idea of meditation, but I feel like it'd be hard. My mind is always racing!": "fear", "Yeah, thankfully there's an app for that - Headspace (no I am not sponsored)": "anger", "Awesome, I'll check that out! I hear all sorts of great things about meditation.": "anticipation", "I am really looking forward to going away for the holidays.": "anticipation", "Me too, do you have any special plans?": "anticipation", "I want to go see the Harry Potter land at Universal, the kids will love it.": "anticipation", "How fun! yes I am sure they will have  a great time!": "joy", "They love the films, plus getting to ride Hogwarts Express, score!": "joy", "I'm really hoping my acceptance letter shows up in the mail soon.": "anticipation", "Is it for college?": "joy", "Law School, I'm pretty sure I got in to my first choice, but you never know.": "joy", "Well good luck, I hope you get in!": "joy", "Thank you, fingers are crossed.": "anticipation", "I just ordered a new cookery book and am eagerly awaiting its arrival. I want to delve in and try lots of new recipes!": "anticipation", "I love cooking! What types of things do you like to cook?": "joy", "I'm vegetarian and cook all sorts of different cuisines - Indian, Italian, American. The only cuisine I'm not good at is Chinese. How about you?": "anticipation", "I am also a vegetarian and I love cooking Italian food.": "anticipation", "Have you heard of Mark Bittman's book How to Cook Everything Vegetarian? That's the book I'm waiting impatiently for!": "joy", "I witnessed the most epic bottle flip in the history of bottle flips at my school": "joy", "Those are so much fun. Was everyone hype?": "joy", "Yee yee, it landed on this little ledge that was super high up.": "disgusted", "Tight. Probably wont be able to do that again!": "sadness", "My little grandson just came home from the hospital. He was born premature and weighted under 2 pounds.": "joy", "Oh my gosh, so tiny. I'm hoping since he was released from the hospital he is doing well now?": "anticipation", "He is doing well, thank you. And we are so thankful everything is ok. It was touch and go for awhile": "trust", "I can imagine. I'm glad to hear he's better! Life is such a gift.": "sadness", "I love my girlfriend.

Good luck!": "joy", "My sister spilled some milk on me. It set me off!": "anger", "I hope it didn't mess up your clothes. I'm sure it was a mistake.": "sadness", "It was indeed a mistake. My clothes are fine now.": "sadness", "I'm glad it didn't mess anything up and that your relationship with your sister is still in tact.": "trust", "I recently did not pay my rent. My land lord has been terrible at providing services": "trust", "Oh no. I rent also so I know your pain. My last landlord was awful.  How did your landlord react?": "anger", "He decided to start caring and doing his part.": "trust", "Oh good, glad he did that instead of just coming down on your for not paying.  Glad it worked out for you.": "trust", "I'm thankful that I was able to repair my tire before it went flat on my car": "trust", "Lucky you did that in time!": "joy", "Right, I caught it just as it happened and brought it to the shop, didn't cost as much as I thought it would either.": "sadness", "Sounds like it worked out great for you!": "joy", "I love my friend. She just drove me to class": "trust", "Wow! You should do something back for her!": "sadness", "I think I am getting her a gift soon!": "joy", "Nice, I am jealous of your friendship!": "trust", "I stole from my friends when I was a child. I feel terrible about it now": "sadness", "Was it something important that you took ?": "sadness", "It was some Pokemon cards!": "joy", "I see, did they ever find out it was you ?": "sadness", "My father almost passed away last year. It was very tough on everyone": "sadness", "That is awful, I am sorry to hear that.  Is he doing better now?": "anger", "Yes, he has made a full recovery! It's been a journey": "joy", "I'm so glad he is better.  Is the whole family doing alright?  I know that can be really hard on people.": "trust", "I remember when I was a young one. I loved life.": "sadness", "Life was easier back then, Hopefully you still love life?": "sadness", "I do, but maybe not with he same flare as before": "sadness", "Nostalgia can stir emotions. You'll find something to love about life again.": "sadness", "I helped find my friend's cats. She's glad they're back now": "trust", "Oh, no!  What happened?  Did she just get loose?  ": "sadness", "Yes they both just wandered off when the door was open!": "fear", "Thankfully, they are both okay.

I feel the same": "joy", "Teeth are weird, but also take a lot of upkeep which is sometimes irritating": "anger", "Always try to brush your teeth at least twice a day, it helps": "anger", "Yeah that's what my dentist says, I'll try": "fear", "If you don't take care of your teeth then you will have a bad time later in life": "trust", "I wake up with chills sometimes for no reason": "joy", "That is bizarre, have you had this seen about?": "sadness", "I think it's from dreams that I'm not able to recall": "joy", "That is odd, are you afraid when you wake up?": "fear", "I wasn't able to reach my goals in the gym a couple days ago, and it helped me realize where I'm slacking off in other areas": "sadness", "You sound a lot like my husband. He is really into going to the gym. Life isnt right if he doesnt get gym time.": "joy", "Yeah, it's fun to see how much you can conquer yourself, and it's nice to be able to see how you're changing": "joy", "I agree. Its pretty cool to see the changes. I never really got into going to the gym though. ": "surprise", "I recently went skydiving. It was a thrilling rush": "fear", "I have been skydiving, too! It was a fun experience.": "fear", "It was excellent. I feel so alive!": "joy", "I lost my hearing for a few hours after though, but other than that it was a wonderful experience.": "fear", "I think I will have success in my life. I love life these days!": "joy", "That is great, did something recently happen?": "joy", "I recently finished a new album I have been working on!": "joy", "Awesome! What type of music?": "joy", "I'm excited to think of all the possibilities that are available to me at the moment": "joy", "What possibilities do you speak of?": "fear", "Being able to learn basically anything with the internet for one": "joy", "That sounds pretty exciting.": "joy", "I like meditating because it puts things into perspective in a way that I don't usually expect": "trust", "I've never been much for meditating. I'm glad you enjoy it.": "trust", "For sure, my mind is pretty energetic": "joy", "What got you into meditation?": "fear", "I've been processing what being lonely feels like, because I want to be able to have fun by myself sometimes": "sadness", "I think that's a good idea so you aren't always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself.": "sadness", "True, and I've felt that way before, but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like I'm not worthy enough and stuff like that, but it's all good": "joy", "Meditation on goals and positive ideas during some of that alone time can be so uplifting and refocuses you.": "sadness", "I'm trying to get over my need to control things, and I find if I just let things happen it feels like a weights been pulled off my shoulders": "fear", "I used to struggle with the same problem, it can be overwhelming": "joy", "Right, but things always seem to turn out for the best anyway": "sadness", "I agree!!": "joy", "I grew up pretty skinny and now that I've grown some muscle I feel a lot more comfortable in my skin": "joy", "Grats.

The back's already packed": "joy", "That sounds nice. Hopefully it isn't too hot for you.": "joy", "I hope not. I'm in Florida so it might get bad": "fear", "Are you going to be sleeping in a tent?": "fear", "My old house burned down, and I went to check it out, was surreal taking a look around the place": "sadness", "That's just so sad.

Is the cat OK now?": "trust", "Yeah, everything turned out fine in the end": "fear", "That's good.  If not for you, who knows what could have happened.  You must be a very caring individual.": "trust", "I feel like deepening my connection to God is the most important thing in my life": "trust", "I think that is a lovely thing": "joy", "It's like if I don't get that sorted out I won't be able to live a fulfilling life": "sadness", "If its important, you will figure it out": "fear", "When I can't take a breather in the day I feel suffocated": "fear", "Yea, its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can": "sadness", "Right, it's like I can't focus or relax": "joy", "I think relaxing is very important": "joy", "When I was in elementary school I was envious of the kids who were popular!": "anger", "Yeah as a child it's hard to see other kids with a bunch of friends when you don't have that many.": "sadness", "Yeah, I just had trouble socializing is all": "sadness", "Well, I hope you got over that issue and ended up making lots of friends yourself.": "sadness", "When I do things that are challenging I feel more self-reliant. I recently tried taking an ice bath": "sadness", "Oh man! thats impressive, those baths are rough.": "joy", "Yeah, my bath wasn't deep enough, so I didn't get covered all the way!": "fear", "That's good. But still! You must be pretty tough!": "sadness", "I'm eating a lot of food to make sure I can lift more weight in the gym next time!": "joy", "Are you taking protein?": "joy", "I'm taking everything, honey, raw garlic, yogurt, EVERYTHING!": "sadness", "That is good, hopefully it helps!": "trust", "I don't like scammy sales people, nothing good comes from it": "joy", "I agree, were you recently screwed by one?": "sadness", "Yeah, it's like they live to manipulate people for money": "disgusted", "Yep its disgusting": "disgusted", "I went to lunch the other day with my kids.

": "disgusted", "Oh that is not good, I hope you were able to clean it up easily...": "anger", "Listening to old artists like they Might Be Giants is my jam": "sadness", "Wow I haven't thought of them in years.

I've had it happen to me once before.": "sadness", "Yes it's been hell, they charged over 15 thousand dollars on it. I hope my identity is fine besides the card.": "sadness", "I sure hope so, too! It is a lot of work to get it sorted out. ": "sadness", "I was pretty disillusioned when I found out door to door sales wasn't a fun time": "trust", "Yeah... that seems like a hard gig, especially in today's day and age, where everyone's so wary, and especially since there's not often people at home during the day. You have to have good people skills to do that job, though. So, you at least probably have that going for you.": "joy", "I realized that it was unethical in the end!": "surprise", "Ah.. yeah, I'm sorry you had to run into that kind of problem.

My daughter is teething so she hasn't been sleeping well.": "trust", "That is such a tough time, my son is teething as well": "trust", "Seeing people taken advantage of by fake religious services is something I find the most vile. It makes them believe that they're doing the right thing, but the person taking advantage of them knows what's really up. What do you know about that?": "anger", "Well I am not a religious person but I will have to say it urks me when I am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me. Then seeing them feel people heads with stuff that they can not prove is there irritates me also": "sadness", "Exactly, I feel that getting people to believe irrational things is the same as giving them a brain virus, it'll slowly erode their ability to think rationally.": "disgusted", "Lol. exactly how I feel": "sadness", "I have a presentation for work on Monday, I'm a little nervous.": "fear", "Oh, thats not unusual.

What was the reason they wanted to wake you up?": "sadness", "I don't know, I didn't answer, pretended I was asleep": "sadness", "Hahaha.. that's kind of goofy in a way.

": "sadness", "Even if she does, it will help make her a well-rounded, relatable person. Usually these things help ground kids and give them character.
