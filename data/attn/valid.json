Of course, we brought the poor babies to our house, a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet.": "caring", "Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in ": "sad", "Yes, I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets, so I wasn't going to keep them, but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together.": "caring", "I wanted to let you know recently i saw a younger man helping an old lady who fell to the ground.

I'm bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah": "embarrassed", "Wow that is big.": "terrified", "My girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot.": "terrified", "What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.": "disgusted", "Well, when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish, I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.": "terrified", "Oh wow, I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.": "apprehensive", "I have to fill out forms all day so I scripted a program that does half of it for me and it works really well!": "prepared", "Thats great.

": "lonely", "That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. ": "joyful", "You are never to old to start. I'm teaching my mate and he is 70 I think. Hopefully I have a boat soon.'": "faithful", "Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!": "annoyed", "I usually hate to ask for help, so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help. ": "grateful", "Wow, 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.  ": "surprised", "That is so exciting, congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family, so having a great group of friends is really important to us. ": "anticipating", "Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? ": "embarrassed", "Get involved in something. Church, a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups, for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!": "faithful", "I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. ": "lonely", "I went to this thing called a Paint Night and I ended up making an okay looking painting": "proud", "That sounds fun, I was never any good at painting": "proud", "I am not either, but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)": "trusting", "That probably helps a good deal!": "terrified", "That Jerk, Did'nt even wave when he cut me off. ": "angry", "I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!": "embarrassed", "After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy.

How are you liking the new job itself?": "faithful", "It's pretty good so far, I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!": "confident", "Awesome, I hope the job goes great for you!": "confident", "When I was a little girl, our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn't think he would come home so we adopted another kitten. ": "caring", "Thats sad, hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you": "devastated", "Well, we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home, or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.": "furious", "Haha thats crazy, I hope they became best friends, I love cats.": "afraid", "I really liked having my mom here. She helped with the kids but then when she left I missed it.": "lonely", "I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!": "ashamed", "Yes, the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.": "annoyed", "Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.": "lonely", "This one time I spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys.": "anticipating", "An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.": "surprised", "Its really not, the foods not worth that long of a wait.": "impressed", "I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.": "furious", "I went to a nice work dinner with my husband. I can't get over how stupid I made myself look. ": "embarrassed", "Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?": "terrified", "I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday. ": "embarrassed", "Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.": "embarrassed", "A lady was having issues with a program on her computer, and I solved it with no problems!": "confident", "That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!": "anticipating", "That sounds unpleasant, did you get in afterwards?": "disgusted", "Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?": "anxious", "I'm so angry they end up charging me 255 in charges that did not belong to me.  ": "furious", "Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen.": "disgusted", "I called them and did not hold back. ": "angry", "Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.": "content", "I was going to go down and go nuts but my wife stopped me. ": "ashamed", "My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired, but she got one right off the bat!": "grateful", "It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?": "disappointed", "I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.": "jealous", "That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?": "devastated", "My girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital, and I go and see her as often as I can.": "hopeful", "I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.": "devastated", "Thanks, I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can, she's my world.": "joyful", "She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!": "caring", "I love going to places that I explored and play at as a child. Every time I go, I always feel super nostalgic.": "nostalgic", "I am very nostalgic too, that must be a fun time!": "nostalgic", "Yes, until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there, and you start feeling old": "nostalgic", "That is true, but it is part of life, but it is cool to see things again, regain perspective": "confident", "I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend, but when my girlfriend first moved into my house, I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way, and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.": "apprehensive", "I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.": "sad", "I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath, and realize its just things, and it was just me being reluctant to change. ": "apprehensive", "Yes, sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!": "content", "I always hate thinking that my son is getting old. Just like a few days ago, I was looking at some of my sons old clothes, and it made me very sentimental. I never want him to get old on me. ": "sentimental", "I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life": "devastated", "Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it. ": "nostalgic", "True, and the good thing is that when the kids grow, they provide moral support to parents.": "angry", "I love a good surprise like anyone else; however, when my girlfriend waited until 8 pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present, I was caught off guard. I thought she had forgot. ": "surprised", "Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!": "sad", "She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.": "guilty", "Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!": "surprised", "I work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day, Not Fair!": "joyful", "Is he a stay at home father, or does he just not want to work?": "surprised", "He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.": "annoyed", "I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.": "annoyed", "Doubtful, he's a punk!": "faithful", "So the other day was my 23rd Birthday! I had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room, a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off, and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! It was such a shock, and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience! ": "surprised", "Must of been pretty surprised, Also great to have friends like that.": "impressed", "It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake, chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery! ": "joyful", "That must of just made everything even better!": "nostalgic", "Right?! I mean who doesn't love cake. But that's not even the best part. on the counter, there was a HUGE pile of presents calling my name. ": "annoyed", "I'm thrilled. I got a raise!": "proud", "That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.": "content", "Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.": "surprised", "You are very lucky": "grateful", "Your not kidding and to think I was going to quit. ": "proud", "Have you seen the film \"within\" on netflix? The other night my boyfriend and i watched it and I had trouble sleeping afterwards, it was pretty creepy!": "afraid", "No I haven't actually, I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. ": "disappointed", "Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out \"within\"!": "prepared", "I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time, but if I do I will definitely check it out!": "content", "I spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat": "guilty", "Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?": "disappointed", "Very! It was a dark maroon stain. ": "terrified", "Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.": "nostalgic", "My wife is angry and I don't know what to say. My anniversary was yesterday and I had no clue!": "furious", "Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations, which of course only makes it worse!": "angry", "I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance. ": "disappointed", "What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing \"your\" song?": "anticipating", "I used diamond earrings. ": "guilty", "So the other night my boyfriend and I were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm I coudn't help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away.": "trusting", "You should not be so insecure like that.": "jealous", "Its not about insecurity! ": "lonely", "What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?": "caring", "Have you ever been to Las Vegas? ": "excited", "yes, several times.The place is magical.": "nostalgic", "I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!": "anticipating", "Well, you are about to have the fun of your life, but gamble responsible.": "joyful", "I was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night, it had left me in absolute shock. I did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose.": "surprised", "Why. Did you started dating recently or something": "lonely", "No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!": "disappointed", "The most important thing is what you want.": "devastated", "I'm one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach. I ride giants.": "anticipating", "Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?": "impressed", "Yes, you can google me.": "content", "Are you still competing on a professional level?": "confident", "Nope, I've got a family now to support so I surf less and work more. But I've still got killer moves. ": "guilty", "I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger.": "furious", "NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously, I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!": "furious", "It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.": "angry", "Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?": "disappointed", "A bowl of dry cereal. ": "furious", "Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!": "sad", "Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.": "angry", "I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!": "terrified", "Have you ever participated in any races, half or full marathons? ": "excited", "I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?": "ashamed", "I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon, it was inspirational!": "proud", "That's great for her. ": "impressed", "I am not afraid to admit this: I am 32 and afraid of the dark. The other day, my electricity went out due to a storm. It was dark, I couldn't find my phone or a light, so I screamed for my girlfriend to wake up. Am I embarrassed to say that, not at all, lol": "afraid", "hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?": "afraid", "I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is, I don't even believe in the supernatural, so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it, I think. ": "afraid", "OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?": "terrified", "Nope. I am just scared that in case there is the supernatural. It makes sense in my head;however, when I am saying it out loud, it doesnt, lol": "terrified", "Before I applied at Inline I really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in.": "confident", "That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?": "disappointed", "I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..": "impressed", "Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!": "confident", "Thank you!  I really enjoy this position a lot so I am happy it turned out well.": "confident", "My husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state I felt really lost and alone for a bit.": "sad", "I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?": "lonely", "Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.": "sad", "Maybe one day if you have the time, you can pay him a surprise visit.": "anxious", "That is a good idea! I'll have to sneak his work schedule and give it a try.": "annoyed", "I made it on time to the bus stop.": "annoyed", "That is good. Where you running late": "prepared", "I was running late and so did the bus.": "embarrassed", "That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind": "annoyed", "So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad.": "guilty", "I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!": "jealous", "Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.": "disgusted", "I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.": "guilty", "I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.": "ashamed", "Sounds like a good idea.": "content", "I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however, that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water. ": "apprehensive", "Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! ": "trusting", "Yes! I start swimming lessons next week.

The good old days.": "faithful", "My mother was always there for me when I was sick, annoyed and sad": "grateful", "That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.": "jealous", "Well my dad too but my mum was so much more, even when I was naughty she was still there.": "guilty", "My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.": "joyful", "When I was little I got chased by a large dog and now that I'm much older the feeling is still the same. ": "lonely", "That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?": "afraid", "I am, everytime I see a dog, I begin to run the other direction instantly": "devastated", "You need to fight your fear": "afraid", "I actually have no friends, can you believe that? I'm ok with it though.": "lonely", "wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!": "sad", "No, it's not sad. I really like to be alone, as i'm an introvert. I need my space.": "lonely", "Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family ": "sad", "Well in that case, I have a few friends. Outside of family, I don't. ": "disgusted", "Do you ever find it hard to see at night when it's raining?": "annoyed", "Yes I do actually, I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. ": "terrified", "That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.": "surprised", "I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. ": "embarrassed", "Thank you. I've never been in a traffic accident. Thank goodness for that.": "anxious", "I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving, an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind": "ashamed", "Oh that was so nice of them!

My boss is one of those people. I wish there was just instance that I could be like this is where he annoyed me, but that isn't the case. It happens every day.

I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.": "apprehensive", "Well, he was 17 at the time, so in his defense, he just was being a \"dumb teenager\".

": "faithful", "Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?": "disappointed", " I do actually! ": "excited", "Congratulations! Studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?": "confident", "I was inspecting rooms yesterday when I bent down to look under a bed, I felt the back of my pants tear. The hole was the entire back of my pants. ": "embarrassed", "Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!": "devastated", "Yes, I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole. ": "disgusted", "Ugh!

She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's.

What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?": "embarrassed", "They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.": "faithful", "That's the worst!

": "content", "I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me, I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!": "anticipating", "That's i'm so scared but it will be worth it. You only have one life so don't hold back.": "terrified", "Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15?": "impressed", "At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.": "anxious", "Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?": "surprised", "Love, it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me.

I hope you did well on it?": "anxious", "Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in, so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade": "angry", "Well, at least you didn't go down in your grade. But, it wasn't right to treat the students like that!": "ashamed", "As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress.

": "anxious", "That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.": "caring", "My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it. ": "annoyed", "Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?": "disgusted", "We don't know them well, but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after, but some people have to get up for work. ": "annoyed", "I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.": "annoyed", "My dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down. It was a very sad, but necessary decision. ": "hopeful", "it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.": "trusting", "It was very hard, but she was suffering.

I'm sure she understands.": "guilty", "My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit. ": "joyful", "Sounds nice.

I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?": "furious", "Yes, it was my partner. He owes me big time": "angry", "I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!": "content", "Right! He says i'm greedy anyway, but that's besides the point!": "jealous", "I got into some serious financial troubles a few years back.": "devastated", "It happens to everyone, are you out of it now?": "embarrassed", "yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/.

I can't take them myself.": "terrified", "I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily": "terrified", "Yes, I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.": "anticipating", "Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.": "jealous", "I just don't think they're safe enough, many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.": "apprehensive", "yeah, and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them": "annoyed", "I'll just stick to the food and go home. Funnel Cakes and Polish Sausages are my favs.": "lonely", "Two years ago, I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it, i was angry and hurt.": "devastated", "I bet you were, I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.": "lonely", "I know it was a horrible experience at the time, now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up": "joyful", "I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.": "angry", "I wish I could go back to the 80's for a little while at times. ": "nostalgic", "Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them": "nostalgic", "That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?": "nostalgic", "Do you have a favorite era?": "nostalgic", "Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life": "nostalgic", "Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think.": "ashamed", "Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed": "afraid", "I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college. ": "surprised", "So if not by studying ,what else?": "disappointed", "I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time!": "embarrassed", "That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? ": "anxious", "No, I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal, but it healed.": "terrified", "You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.": "jealous", "That's hilarious! I can't afford it right now though. I'll just be more careful.": "guilty", "Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core.": "hopeful", "That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!": "excited", "My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.": "devastated", "Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!": "devastated", "I can't believe my husband planned this all by himself! My mind is still blown by this!": "surprised", "Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?": "proud", "We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings, but mostly excited!": "anticipating", "When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?": "anxious", "It's our 10th anniversary. We are making the drive to FL since we live in Georgia. ": "disappointed", "Don't you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can't? Well, that happened to me recently. I was going to give away some of my son's old toys, but started looking at then and realized that I need to keep them for no other reason than that I was being sentimental ": "sentimental", "That's too funny. You know, I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!": "nostalgic", "I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol": "disappointed", "Yes, someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling": "nostalgic", "I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago, and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago": "sentimental", "I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?": "sad", "Yes, we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town, so it allowed me to get really close with her.": "disappointed", "That's sweet, I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!": "caring", "I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday, when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics.": "afraid", "Wow, that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?": "devastated", "They couldn't capture him, he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.": "terrified", "That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!": "confident", "I hope not! I'm not good with crisis situations at all!": "disgusted", "Yes, I was surprise on how he changed to another talk": "surprised", "What was the initial talk?": "impressed", "I should descript how I could feel when am lonely": "lonely", "So how do you feel when lonely?": "lonely", "Wow, the situation is always very bad": "angry", "It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!": "faithful", "Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.": "annoyed", "yes, i understood the first time.": "devastated", "Oh, sorry, I meant to say Ex-wife. I am so glad she didn't. The years haven't be kind to her, so got out just at the right time, lol": "jealous", "I slipped on a puddle in the mall once. I was so embarrassed that I pretended I was hurt badly.": "ashamed", "I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt,": "embarrassed", "Even animals get embarrassed, I've seen it in my cats.": "furious", "Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.": "anticipating", "Yes, my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.": "devastated", "Oh dang, talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol": "embarrassed", "One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened": "embarrassed", "That is a hilarious intro, thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things, you have nothing to worry about ;-))": "apprehensive", "Well, I most def want to be insightful and intelligent, so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about, but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing \"Along Came Polly\" sceneros in your head. ": "anxious", "These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov, you crazy kids!": "annoyed", "Lately, my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls,i don't even want to think of i": "sentimental", "Is that good or bad? Why the concern?": "angry", "I think it is bad": "guilty", "OK why do you think so?": "jealous", "Boys are meant to be playing with car toys not dolls.": "sentimental", "It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can.": "trusting", "Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem": "trusting", "It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.": "guilty", "I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another, we would not have much problem": "trusting", "That is so true! There is no reason for there to be a problem with famine in the world.": "terrified", "My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test.": "confident", "Well you should try to study more and see what happens": "disappointed", "I did, I can't remember, I either made an A or a B in there.": "surprised", "Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf": "disappointed", "Well, this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever, but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago, I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me, and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks, in the middle of the road, jumped out, and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short, I saw my own reflection in the mirror. ": "terrified", "THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.": "afraid", "It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it, lol": "sad", "That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?": "afraid", "I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore.

Do you think you guys will be a good fit?": "apprehensive", "He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations, and I have to say, I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other, so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.": "caring", "Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact.

That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?": "terrified", "They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around.

Did they call someone?": "trusting", "You hope your teens make the right choices, but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong.  He is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much.  I believe this is healthy, but I can help but want something different.": "jealous", "I know it is hard to start letting go, but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry, you are not alone.": "guilty", "That's what my own mother says.  In fact, she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said, \"Hey, I'm staying the night at so and so's, be back tomorrow.\"  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!": "ashamed", "Yeah, they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.": "sentimental", "I witness a great sight.

But that's nice that they're that helpful.": "caring", "The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.": "apprehensive", "Ohh, that makes sense. Yeah, then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip.

I was scared to get the news.": "anxious", "I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad, I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?": "prepared", "I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it, and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news, but still had to have removed.": "anxious", "I'm so glad to hear it was good news, though!": "surprised", "Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family.": "jealous", "Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute, so cherish those you love!": "jealous", "It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.": "anxious", "It doesn't help us no.

My husband was excited when I was pregnant, but I don't think he got it until he arrived.": "surprised", "Have you ever been hospitalized? It's not much fun. I had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days.": "devastated", "I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?": "terrified", "I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.": "grateful", "Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.": "anxious", "I have a full time job that doesn't pay anything.": "guilty", "That really sucks man.

Everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!": "prepared", "I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?": "prepared", "We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!": "disgusted", "Oh wow!

The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there, the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out, this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.

If they are on my property i should have the right without the sign.": "angry", "Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.": "terrified", "my husband treated me to a week at disney, i had no idea!": "surprised", "That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?": "excited", "disney world. it's the only one Ive ever been to .": "joyful", "Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!": "surprised", "Oh my, you must be there every day then!": "devastated", "i am pretty happy right now, i don't think i have ever been happier with my life.": "content", "That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?": "joyful", "Exactly! I used to struggle but i don't anymore": "proud", "You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy. ": "grateful", "I do every chance i get, and thank you!": "grateful", "My daughter went out of town, but she promised me she wouldn't do anything I wouldn't approve of, and I believe her, so I let her go.": "disappointed", "that's great that you can trust her.  how old?": "trusting", "Yeah, she's a good kid and hasn't given me any reason to think otherwise. She just turned 18.": "sad", "That's great. Be thankful, some people aren't so lucky.": "grateful", "Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing at Walmart!": "embarrassed", "what did you almost buy?": "surprised", "It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad, but when I got there, it looked cheap and shabby!": "content", "It's hard to find good quality at walmart": "nostalgic", "I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else, right?": "faithful", "I would try target.  good quality stuff there.": "anticipating", "I could try online, but I'd have to buy it first and then see if it's good quality.": "anticipating", "try googling it, and read thru the reviews": "apprehensive", "i am trying to sell my house, i hope i can find a buyer": "anticipating", "Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?": "guilty", "I hope i do.  We will see, I know it can take a while.\\": "ashamed", "Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate, right?  Location, Location, Location.": "anticipating", "yes i live behind a school.": "excited", "Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then": "trusting", "yes, but i will leave that to the listing agent.": "faithful", "You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?": "apprehensive", "I had to leave my last job because this manager they brought in was such an incompetent doofus.": "furious", "Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?": "annoyed", "He was the \"marketing manager\" but couldn't market his way out of a paper bag, it was impossible to work with him. Plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse.": "jealous", "Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now, with a manager who cares.": "furious", "I am actually, thank you for caring!": "surprised", "i am concerned about my father": "anxious", "Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?": "devastated", "he is old, and he lives alone.  i just worry because he is getting old.  he gets on ok, but i don't know how much longer.": "sad", "Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age. ": "devastated", "no it's not, but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day.": "nostalgic", "We can surely hope! ": "disappointed", "My neighbor asked me to watch over his dog. I told him he could trust me, but he escaped and ran away.": "trusting", "That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?": "furious", "I feel so bad. I forgot to lock the gate. No, but I put up a lot of posters, so hopefully I find him before my neighbor comes back.": "sad", "I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.": "guilty", "I used to have this obnoxious neighbor who stayed up all night playing League of Legends, he drove me nuts screaming into his headset all hours of the day and night.": "angry", "Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?": "guilty", "His parents paid his bills so no, he didn't understand that sadly. I tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn't get the picture as he kept doing it.": "disappointed", "You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.": "annoyed", "i have a new job offer, but im not sure if i should take it": "apprehensive", "What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?": "angry", "well, it is retail.  ive done retail and it is not fun.": "ashamed", "Yeah, I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.": "ashamed", "that's true. i don't like dealing with people.": "furious", "So this one time I walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself. He just taught himself to do it, I had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool.": "impressed", "lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time": "nostalgic", "I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.": "impressed", "wow , i would love to have a cat like yours ": "caring", "I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things.": "lonely", "Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?": "sad", "It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.": "joyful", "haha that must have been a crazy concert! ": "surprised", "This friend of mine is constantly job hopping, I don't even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily, whereas when I left my last job I could barely get interviews.": "jealous", "Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as, say, an administrative job": "excited", "She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.": "anticipating", "Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture": "hopeful", "I am ready to start renovating the rest of my house.": "prepared", "OOO I love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?": "devastated", "I finished my kitchen, so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really. ": "sentimental", "Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!": "joyful", "Oh yes, we haven't decided on the color yet.": "anticipating", "This morning I woke up and I was in such a good mood that I just started singing in the shower.": "embarrassed", "That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?": "grateful", "I don't know, I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.": "ashamed", "Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!": "terrified", "I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little, how different the world was.": "nostalgic", "I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff": "nostalgic", "Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!": "grateful", "Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids": "proud", "For my birthday last year, a coworker gave me cheese. It sounds ridiculous but I was touched by her thoughtfulness. I love cheese!": "surprised", "I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?": "guilty", "Smoked gouda, one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha": "ashamed", "Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?": "joyful", "YES. Basically anything meat and cheese and I am totally there!": "content", "My cat had really bad breath so I took her in to the dentist. It turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled, poor thing was in so much pain.": "anxious", "Aww poor baby, hopefully shes doing fine now.": "caring", "She's doing great, thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.": "proud", "That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.": "caring", "When I was a kid, I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's, just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food.": "prepared", "Ha, I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.": "disappointed", "Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.": "terrified", "True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!": "joyful", "I'm so nervous. I had a job interview the other day and haven't heard back yet.": "anxious", "Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?": "embarrassed", "They said within the week, I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!": "joyful", "I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!": "anticipating", "Unfortunately, I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.": "confident", "Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)": "hopeful", "I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!": "angry", "I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like \"okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?\" Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.": "embarrassed", "I went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that I did not order. ": "disgusted", "Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?": "angry", "It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.": "sad", "I would have complained.": "annoyed", "Oh, I did, she immediately said ok I'll take it off like it happened all the time. Made me think it was done on purpose just to see if I  wouldn't notice.": "angry", "Since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away, I usually spend Thanksgiving alone. It sucks sometimes.": "lonely", "Ohh, I feel sorry for you": "devastated", "Oh don't feel bad, I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.": "nostalgic", "Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!": "trusting", "I spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment. It sucked at the time but it was so nice when I was done to just chill out and watch TV.": "content", "Yes, I feel you. Cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!": "impressed", "Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.": "confident", "Me too! You seem just like me!": "hopeful", "My husband and I closed on our first house last week!": "excited", "That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?": "proud", "It is! Lots of blood, sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things, haha. We can't wait to move in!": "afraid", "That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!": "sentimental", "my daughter moved to California and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing I could immediately do.": "devastated", "Are there any other family members out there that could help her?": "angry", "No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.": "sad", "Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out.": "joyful", "They took her to the hospital for evaluation but she ended up just being a bit bruised up. I was worried something like this would happen. Everything did work out in the end though.": "anxious", "Recently I was contacted by my former company, begging to get me back. I felt really good about the salary negotiation since I knew they needed me.": "hopeful", "That's great! I am happy for you!": "confident", "Thanks, I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week, it's pretty amazing.": "excited", "Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!": "grateful", "i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !": "impressed", "i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule ": "anxious", "yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.": "anticipating", "same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will ": "lonely", "yes i think it is going to be a long week or so.": "anticipating", "My dog died this past December and I've had a really hard time getting over it. She was our family pet.": "sad", "I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past, so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.": "devastated", "She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently, which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives. ": "joyful", "Aww that's great! What breed? ": "caring", "The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy.": "afraid", "Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?": "afraid", "Yes, thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!": "grateful", "Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long": "terrified", "my doggie recently passed away": "proud", "I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.": "devastated", "no i don't think so, but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.  ": "disgusted", "Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!": "terrified", "i don't think i will ever know. they usually don't stop when that happens.": "annoyed", "The other day I woke up and without looking I stepped in warm cat vomit.": "disgusted", "oh man, that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.": "disgusted", "Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey, I should have known better and watched where I was walking.": "disgusted", "how many cats do have?": "caring", "Well right now I have six but they're not all mine, I foster for a cat rescue. Three are mine, three are for adoption. It gets crazy in my house!": "annoyed", "My dog died last year. ": "sad", "Aw, I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?": "sad", "About 5 years. He was a rescue.": "devastated", "They say dogs are mans best friend. ": "sad", "That's true. He was definitely mine.": "trusting", "What kind of dog was he?": "sad", "He was a pit and lab mix.": "devastated", "Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. ": "anxious", "The worst phone call I ever got in my life was when I was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live.": "sad", "Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago, I know how terrible that feels.": "devastated", "I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.": "devastated", "Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day,": "sad", "They will live on in our love and memories. I hope the heaviness lessens one day at a time <3": "anticipating", "The other day I checked my email and a former client I did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! I was happy.": "anticipating", "surprise gifts are always fun.": "joyful", "Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.": "surprised", "that sounds like a well deserved plan.": "prepared", "I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters, but just being there changed my mind quickly.": "apprehensive", "Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment": "ashamed", "Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.": "surprised", "Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away": "afraid", "i lost $100 cash somewhere. I have looked everywhere and i can't find it": "devastated", "that sounds prettty bad!": "terrified", "yes, i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.": "afraid", "I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.": "devastated", "i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.": "annoyed", "Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!": "sentimental", "I really hate when people let their kids run wild in public. I do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it.": "terrified", "I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. ": "ashamed", "The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly. ": "angry", "The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.": "angry", "I wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out.": "sad", "What store were you at? ": "furious", "I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today. ": "disgusted", "Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? ": "annoyed", "It get's worse no rain check but they insist on giving me customer service number to still receive points towards my card.": "annoyed", "it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared ": "caring", "Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? ": "lonely", "thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!": "surprised", "Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.": "joyful", "yes she is honestly the greatest ": "proud", "That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.": "impressed", "I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more?": "anticipating", "Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol": "surprised", "Right! It's almost like, you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!": "angry", "That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.": "disappointed", "I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout, I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up.": "disgusted", "Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.": "embarrassed", "Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.": "annoyed", "Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.": "annoyed", "We can only hope.": "hopeful", "When I was in high school there was a girl I had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend.": "jealous", "Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?": "sad", "Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my \"friend\" asked her out.": "faithful", "Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.": "furious", "I had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out.  Some time later I found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one.": "jealous", "Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that": "jealous", "Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.": "grateful", "That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times": "content", "It really does.  I think when it comes to friends quality is better than quantity.  I like to have friends that feel like family.": "lonely", "I cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her VPK graduation.": "devastated", "That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now": "proud", "Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.": "sad", "That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!": "excited", "I entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won $1000.": "surprised", "Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?": "confident", "Oh they are long gone,lol. Bills to pay and all.": "anxious", "Bills do take up a lot, don't they.": "lonely", "They sure do. The raffle did allow me to get ahead of things for a while though.": "hopeful", "One time I moved into a new apartment, it was this big loft in a converted warehouse. I had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound, I thought the place was haunted!": "afraid", "Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?": "terrified", "Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.": "afraid", "How did you discover exactly what it was?": "furious", "I turned off the TV and my phone and tried to trace the sound to its source. I feel ridiculous about it now in hindsight!": "embarrassed", "I have a fear for roller coaster but I let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night.": "trusting", "Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?": "afraid", "Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride. ": "terrified", "I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!": "angry", "My hands was up and feeling the wind in my face and facing my fears but I kept them closed because I just couldn't look because of the height lol. ": "terrified", "I had to put my cat down a few years ago, she was old and in kidney failure.": "sad", "I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.": "devastated", "She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat, she came to live with me when my mom died.": "sad", "You went through a lot of losses.": "devastated", "Someone buggy was in the way at Publix and I tripped and fell in the aisle. ": "embarrassed", "That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall. ": "ashamed", "I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly. ": "embarrassed", "Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay. ": "embarrassed", "I applied for a job one time where I was one of 4 people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if I got it.": "hopeful", "Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!": "anxious", "I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.": "apprehensive", "Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?": "impressed", "I remember being younger and waiting on Christmas Day to unwrap presents.  There were a lot of things I wanted that year.": "hopeful", "I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?": "nostalgic", "Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.": "disappointed", "The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?": "nostalgic", "Yea, they tried to trick me and wrap a box of clothes the same size to make me think I didn't get it.  My favorite game has to be Earthbound.": "surprised", "I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating.": "embarrassed", "Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?": "caring", "You're right, the other people probably hardly noticed. And no, thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.": "ashamed", "I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!": "terrified", "That's solid advice, thank you. And yes, I own a helmet, but admittedly don't wear it as often as I should. I will now!": "terrified", "This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries, canned goods, beer. I was set!": "prepared", "How'd the hurricane go?": "prepared", "Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest, though glad we were safe.": "trusting", "Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.": "devastated", "I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it.": "anxious", "Was he okay?": "guilty", "He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it, he is a very nervous dog.": "apprehensive", "Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.": "afraid", "That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.": "trusting", "Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.": "content", "I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.": "sentimental", "I bet he is. Don't worry": "anticipating", "I usually food prep for the week it is so much easier.": "confident", "That is a great idea": "hopeful", "Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track. ": "impressed", "Saving money is important": "joyful", "My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year": "proud", "That's amazing! You must be so proud.": "proud", "Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.": "joyful", "She's also a hard worker.": "content", "I like to think so, although it seemed to alwasy be easy for her. ": "apprehensive", "Yesterday my Lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment. I thought that was super nice, there were A LOT of bags.": "grateful", "That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.": "grateful", "It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it, I didn't want to hold him up. ": "faithful", "Good to know there is still kind people in the world.": "trusting", "I got some pink roses at work last week I was so happy.": "surprised", "That's awesome! Who were they from?": "terrified", "My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.": "surprised", "That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.": "grateful", "I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband, our four kids, and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though": "anxious", "You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.": "prepared", "I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough. ": "disgusted", "That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!": "excited", "I sent an email I shouldn't have sent. I'd been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when I did.": "embarrassed", "We all do things we regret when drinking": "guilty", "True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days, worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.": "terrified", "Thats usually how it goes": "impressed", "A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here.": "afraid", "You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?": "trusting", "It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.": "content", "hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.": "confident", "I'm going back to school I am going to stick to my goal and don't stop until I get my degree.": "faithful", "I wish you luck": "hopeful", "Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.": "confident", "I am sure you will meet them": "lonely", "I spent my birthday last year alone. I expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope.": "lonely", "That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?": "disappointed", "Yeah, he acted like it was just a normal day, it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.": "angry", "I would have been disappointed, too. ": "disappointed", "I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer. ": "annoyed", "Oh no that is a total bummer.

What is your job?": "prepared", "I work for the state we help clients with disabilities find employment it is case management work.": "prepared", "I got a random email this morning with a $120 gift voucher": "furious", "Wow was it a scam or was it legit?": "annoyed", "I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago!": "confident", "That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?": "anticipating", "Thanks!

When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.": "anticipating", "That has happend to me too.": "disgusted", "I got my hopes up too much.

It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately, we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.": "surprised", "ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse": "angry", "We went to our favorite Italian restaurant for dinner tonight.": "nostalgic", "Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.": "sad", "It was good! It always is. I had my \"usual\" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed, but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday.": "content", "That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy": "content", "I didn't have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location": "annoyed", "Hm, that sounds interesting.

What exactly happened, or what did that mean?": "furious", "Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep": "grateful", "Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it.

": "furious", "That is awful, did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? ": "furious", "No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed.

I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests": "confident", "Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college, it was a wakeup call.": "afraid", "Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence": "anxious", "So all my friends went on vacation last week :(": "disappointed", "Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?": "lonely", "Yeah, we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work.

What is it like?": "disgusted", "It's very cold and refreshing, wakes you up instantly.": "content", "I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !": "anxious", "My neighbor refuses to clean up after her dog and it's infuriating.": "angry", "wow that is very rude of her": "disgusted", "It really is.

Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.": "content", "I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.": "devastated", "Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly, once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality. ": "terrified", "It can be, but personality can't make up for incomptence either.": "joyful", "I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.": "angry", "I flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time. I can't believe how much time has passed.": "surprised", "Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!": "nostalgic", "Enjoy it, your 30s go by really fast. I'm clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself.": "anticipating", "I'm sure it will.

Mindset is so important. ": "terrified", "Someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise.": "jealous", "That's awesome!  What do they do?": "impressed", "They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.": "jealous", "That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.": "jealous", "Last week driving to work, I got pulled over for speeding.": "grateful", "That sucks. How fast were you driving?": "annoyed", "Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.": "terrified", "I hate getting pulled over too.

How long will it be going on?": "afraid", "My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby.": "surprised", "Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky, depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?": "grateful", "Yeah, it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.": "surprised", "Well, then congratulations!

It was alright, but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first.": "surprised", "I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? ": "ashamed", "I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.": "anxious", "right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! ": "confident", "My mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer.": "devastated", "Is she doing okay now?": "guilty", "Yes, she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving.

Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?": "nostalgic", "No, the guy that got it was qualified, it's just I really wanted the job. It would have really help my career.": "jealous", "I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!": "hopeful", "I bought a scratch off lottery ticket the other day, and won $5000.": "jealous", "That is amazingly lucky! good for you!": "grateful", "I almost passed out, I have never won so much money before.": "surprised", "That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!": "trusting", "Had to take my cat to the vet. He's got a bad injury on his paw and it hasn't been healing.": "sad", "Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he? ": "caring", "He's 8 years old. They're going to have to put him down - turns out he has feline aids :(": "impressed", "Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :( ": "angry", "One of my art pieces has been chosen to be put in a exhibition!": "impressed", "I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it? ": "excited", "Haven't been paid for it yet, but people that visit are welcome to put in an offer for anything they see! Fingers crossed someone wants mine!": "terrified", "Hopefully! that would be so amazing! ": "hopeful", "I was enjoying the morning watching the kids play in the pool.": "impressed", "That sounds like such a fun, peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool, it's been scorching outside!": "anticipating", "Well it's only a kiddie pool, kids are very little. It was a very nice morning.": "anxious", "Ah okay, nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)": "sentimental", "As a child, I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it.": "ashamed", "Aw, well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.": "angry", "True, but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today, but I never can take those things back.": "caring", "Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.": "annoyed", "my husband and i lostour daughter 2years ago and i don't care to celebrate mother's day and he still impressed me with a gift": "surprised", "I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?": "devastated", "he got my favorite flower, an orchid a card and made dinner ": "sentimental", "That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.": "surprised", "thanks": "guilty", "Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1,000 miles, and I felt like such a fool.": "guilty", "Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. ": "ashamed", "Agreed, and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!": "sad", "Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol ": "embarrassed", "My cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night. I still can't figure out how he did it.": "disappointed", "Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?": "impressed", "He is! Well, both smart and dumb haha. Had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!": "apprehensive", "Well at least you managed to save him!": "ashamed", "I've got a coworker with zero social skills, and it's driving me batty. She can't seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for 30 minutes straight.": "annoyed", "Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?": "sentimental", "If you make a comment on anything, say cats, she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).": "surprised", "That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.": "angry", "We had an annoying client the other day, and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).": "annoyed", "Did it feel good to get it out?": "confident", "It did at first, until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! It was humiliating and I felt really bad for her after that.": "ashamed", "Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?": "ashamed", "I found some baby kittens in my yard, their mother was dead. I nursed them to health and found homes for them.": "caring", "That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.": "excited", "They are my favorite, too. I love how independent they are.": "sentimental", "Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!": "caring", "Finances aren't great right now. I've got a lot of bills that are overdue, but I can't afford to pay them :(": "surprised", "I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.": "disgusted", "I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks, and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.": "angry", "Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.": "content", "I was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test": "prepared", "You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!": "surprised", "I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off ": "confident", "Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!": "content", "A few years back I got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money. It broke me, I really loved that job.": "devastated", "Oh no, I am so sorry. What did you do?": "devastated", "To be honest, I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.": "embarrassed", "That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?": "lonely", "I did, yeah. And strangely enough, the company hired me back a few years later when they were doing better cashflow-wise. ": "annoyed", "im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night": "excited", "Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?": "impressed", "about a year and a half!": "anticipating", "I hope you all have some fun.": "excited", "I'm SO ready for fall - it's been incredibly hot all summer, and I need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!": "joyful", "Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!": "nostalgic", "Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters, snuggling up with a hot drink, and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!": "excited", "It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!": "excited", "A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.": "annoyed", "Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.": "nostalgic", "Thanks for the tip, I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!": "annoyed", "Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!": "disgusted", "I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have.": "hopeful", "That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.": "joyful", "Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages, but it's been stressful ever since.": "hopeful", "It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.": "prepared", "My friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that I didn't know about.": "prepared", "oh that was nice of them": "surprised", "Yeah, they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.": "angry", "haha thats pretty fun": "confident", "I have an adorable hamster that doesn't look like he's doing well. He is on the old side for hamsters, and I'm worried he won't live much longer.": "devastated", "Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?": "sad", "Thank you, me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him, but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.": "sad", "Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!": "anticipating", "I went back to work for my former company recently. They laid me off a few years ago when things were tough. Coming back was a little scary but I was thrilled!": "afraid", "That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!": "prepared", "Yes, that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.": "angry", "I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!": "confident", "im upset that my neighbor's dog is sick": "sad", "That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?": "disappointed", "no they are at the vet now": "sad", "Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?": "sad", "Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day, great dinner, concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan...": "angry", "Oh no, what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!": "disappointed", "Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!": "sentimental", "Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!": "disappointed", "Very true and thats the way to look at it. I was a bit dispirited but the hotel were great and re-arranged it for us and to be honest I could never have left my baby when she was poorly. The best made plans dont always work out when you have kids, but hey I wouldnt change them for the world.": "apprehensive", "My neighbor has a brand new Tesla and every time I look at it I get so envious. I know it's stupid, I should be happy for him that he has such a cool car.": "jealous", "Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?": "grateful", "Well that's the thing, I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit. ": "embarrassed", "You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.": "jealous", "That is a really good way to put it, I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.": "confident", "lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!": "faithful", "A Tesla with a bike rack!": "impressed", "Exactly!": "confident", "I'm happy my package just arrived": "excited", "oh thats nice": "nostalgic", "im glad it came earlier": "grateful", "yea i would be to": "jealous", "I'm feeling nostalgic today": "nostalgic", "I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier": "nostalgic", "Nostalgia is a weird feeling.": "nostalgic", "I've got a fun weekend coming up, and I'm really looking forward to it!": "joyful", "Nice, what do you have planned?": "excited", "Going to the drive-in, out to eat, and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special, just haven't had fun in awhile!": "joyful", "Sound great, I'm happy for you!": "joyful", "I recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!": "impressed", "Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!": "proud", "It felt amazing to be recognized for my work, and in a publication I respect to boot! ": "impressed", "Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.": "proud", "Well I certainly wasn't expecting it so who knows, maybe one day you will!": "surprised", "I am going to Disney next year. I want to write a list of everything to bring.": "prepared", "What are some things you will bring?": "hopeful", "I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.": "prepared", "It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.": "prepared", "Things have been rough for me lately, but thankfully I've got family and a fiance that are helping me through it.": "grateful", "What is wrong? Are you okay?": "lonely", "I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs, and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/": "hopeful", "I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.": "devastated", "the rain today is frustrating": "annoyed", "We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.": "surprised", "im not a fan of it at all": "sad", "Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.": "excited", "The other day I was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign, nearly hitting me. Thank goodness I was paying attention and was able to stop in time.": "devastated", "Oh my goodness, I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!": "terrified", "I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.": "furious", "Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!": "disappointed", "Thank you, I appreciate that!": "faithful", "My boyfriend proposed to me, and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise.": "surprised", "Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?": "anticipating", "Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year, but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!": "hopeful", "Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.": "proud", "I just had my birthday and I ate WAY too much. Had a good time, but boy do I feel bad for all of that food. I'm supposed to be eating healthier!": "ashamed", "I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.": "nostalgic", "No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too, and how could I say no to that?": "angry", "Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.": "anticipating", "i am pleased with the day im having today": "impressed", "Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.": "sentimental", "me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad": "faithful", "That is true. It puts things in context.": "anticipating", "Every night before bed, we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life.": "proud", "That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. ": "proud", "It is. And shows that he is listening. ": "disgusted", "It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. ": "disgusted", "Our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby.": "annoyed", "that is frustrating, especially if the weather isnt ideal ": "annoyed", "Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.": "furious", "that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!": "sad", "Thank you! At least I was able to get it replaced.": "disgusted", "My friend left my front door open when she was house-sitting for me. My cat snuck out and was killed.": "furious", "That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?": "annoyed", "I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.": "disappointed", "Are you going to get another cat?": "sad", "When I'm ready, I think yes.": "prepared", "I can't wait for it to be Christmas already. Just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy.": "joyful", "I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!": "anticipating", "Exactly! And the food, and friends. All of it is just so lovely.": "grateful", "I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!": "content", "Each day waking up I can't believe how lucky am I just to be alive.": "nostalgic", "That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.": "devastated", "Yes, I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.": "content", "That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.": "impressed", "I went running for the first time in months. I could not believe it. I was able to run a full 8 miles with out taking a break.": "joyful", "8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!": "impressed", "Yes, my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.": "nostalgic", "Have you been a long time runner before that?": "confident", "Not really. A few years ago I got tired of being fat so one day I just went out and started running. Two months ago I stopped due to hurting my back surfing. I got the all clear yesterday and went back out.": "lonely", "Just gave my wife access to my credit card. I'm worried but excited I can trust her. Do you ever have issues trusting people?": "trusting", "I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!": "disgusted", "It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.": "surprised", "Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?": "apprehensive", "It was fun. Adults only resort, all inclusive, private swimming pool off the room but cost 500 a day.": "surprised", "\"I've been at my current job 5 years. I'm at the point I can go into upper management but I'm afraid. Maybe I'm just comfortable now. I don't know. ": "apprehensive", "That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?": "prepared", "An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA, I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well. ": "apprehensive", "Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.": "anticipating", "I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.": "content", "Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?": "apprehensive", "I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves, Color me impressed!": "impressed", "Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!": "content", "Yes,  I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.": "surprised", "Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!": "proud", "A friend of mine bought a new car": "jealous", "awesome! what kind?": "impressed", "Tesla, I've had my eye on the model for some time": "jealous", "oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat": "furious", "A friend of mine got a new high paying job": "grateful", "That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?": "impressed", "I thought it was amazing he got it, seemed like a tough job to land": "impressed", "That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.": "content", "A co-worker of mine was late delivering materials for a project": "trusting", "Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?": "disappointed", "The guy just doesn't seem to care": "angry", "That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.": "hopeful", "Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit. ": "apprehensive", "It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.": "anticipating", "I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.": "anxious", "I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.": "disappointed", "im scared of this big test tomorrow": "anxious", "Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!": "anxious", "yes i have, still nervous though": "apprehensive", "Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!": "anxious", "My wife and I are on a diet together for the last month. We have been doing great but today on my way home from work I stopped for Ice cream and did not tell her.": "ashamed", "Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. ": "faithful", "Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow. ": "annoyed", "It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!": "faithful", "I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing.": "afraid", "You only get to do it once?": "prepared", "Yes, you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.": "hopeful", "Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.": "afraid", "I finally got a raise at my job": "joyful", "Congrats!": "confident", "I was pretty happy, it was long overdue": "surprised", "Was it more than expected?": "impressed", "The other day I was drinking and sent an email I shouldn't have. I felt so stupid when I woke up and realized what I'd done.": "embarrassed", "That has happened to me, but with texts though lol": "terrified", "Yeah I've done that, too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.": "afraid", "Did you apologize?": "guilty", "No, when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!": "hopeful", "LOL": "sad", "My car has been having issues lately": "angry", "what's wrong with it?": "furious", "Engine issues I think, not sure if the car will make it": "apprehensive", "can you fix it?": "confident", "Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds.": "surprised", "That is great news. Have you also been working out?": "proud", "Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.": "devastated", "Has it been easy or hard to do that?": "proud", "Rough. I used to like Iced tea and now only drink black coffee or water. I miss flavor. Plus it's a lot of work cooking everything.": "nostalgic", "I took some candy a friend left out": "ashamed", "did they notice it was missing?": "embarrassed", "Not yet, I plan on compensating my friend for what I took": "ashamed", "well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.": "lonely", "I just realized today I have not been home to where my family is from in a little over 10 years.": "sad", "Ohh wow! Are you excited?": "joyful", "No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.": "annoyed", "Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though": "disappointed", "The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint.": "annoyed", "That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?": "afraid", "Yeah that's what made it weird, it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.": "anxious", "Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all.": "annoyed", "I hope that's all it was and not that he had some bad motive.": "trusting", "A close friend said she was having problems with her knee": "impressed", "Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.": "devastated", "Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it": "anxious", "Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!": "faithful", "A co-worker stole my lunch": "furious", "I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?": "grateful", "Not entirely sure, I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs": "apprehensive", "Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone.": "jealous", "A friend of mine revealed a deep dark secret I told her in confidence to everyone. ": "hopeful", "What did you do?": "surprised", "I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.": "furious", "You definitely can't be too careful these days": "embarrassed", "You're right. It makes me less likely to trust others in the future.": "trusting", "Every single time I go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something. If I don't go to the bathroom no one comes in all day.": "annoyed", "how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?": "afraid", "Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.": "embarrassed", "ok": "sad", "I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet.": "embarrassed", "Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.": "impressed", "It's funny you say that, I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy, which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.": "angry", "Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.": "jealous", "Here's hoping your cat grows on you, they have a funny ability to do so.": "annoyed", "I got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that's higher than I usually charge.": "disappointed", "Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!": "confident", "Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.": "content", "Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. ": "apprehensive", "That always makes it worth it to be honest!": "disgusted", "Someone hit my car and fled the scene": "angry", "What! First of all, are you alright?": "confident", "Yeah, I'm fine, the car was parked": "afraid", "Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though.": "disappointed", "'m promoting two staff members on Sunday. They work hard and are great people.": "disappointed", "That's great.

I have faith that you can do it.": "confident", "Thank you. I hope i reach my goal.": "content", "I paid off my credit card before buying my house.  I didnt realize how expensive owning would be and after some repairs I owe more than I started with on my card.": "excited", "That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?": "sentimental", "Im hoping I wont have to.  Unless something major comes up I'm not planning on putting anything on credit again.": "hopeful", "That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that, I'm cutting them up.": "anxious", "I was with some friends and went up to my room.  It was late at night and the lights were off.  When I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.": "embarrassed", "That would have really scared me.": "afraid", "It did scare me.  I let out a scream.  One of my friends went to school for wildlife.

Im sure they were looking forward to it.": "jealous", "My roommate was very forgetful.  He would sometimes leave his dogs poop bags inside instead of bringing them out to the garage.": "disgusted", "ewww.": "guilty", "It was gross.  All of a sudden you would smell something and then notice the bag sitting there.": "disgusted", "Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?": "disgusted", "I was watching TV and saw people with a happy family. It breaks my heart.": "sad", "You are having trouble with family ?": "afraid", "My family isn't close, it's depressing.": "sad", "Mine isn't either.

Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you. ": "sad", "I'm about to move and I'm terrified! What if it has bugs? Or mold? Or something else I don't know about?": "disgusted", "Oh gosh, you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear": "terrified", "Yes! I can't imagine them crawling on me when I sleep :/": "disgusted", "I would have a heart attack! ": "devastated", "I remember eating my Baba's pierogies as a child, so yummy.": "anticipating", "I have no idea what those are!": "embarrassed", "They are ukrainian pasta, kind of like stuffed pasta.": "impressed", "oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?": "ashamed", "I am so sad I have no pierogies.": "disgusted", "What are pierogies? a type of food?": "anticipating", "They are Ukrainian dumplings.": "caring", "Ah nice, I love dumplings, what are in them?": "anticipating", "The milk I drank this mornign went bad!": "afraid", "That's no good, did you throw it out?": "furious", "Yes, but not before I drank some. :/": "ashamed", "Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.": "lonely", "I once had a fluffy cat named Leo, but he got lymphoma and I had to have him put to sleep.": "joyful", "Oh, I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!": "lonely", "I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs.": "devastated", "Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!": "annoyed", "I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger, and I have one right now named Chunk.": "annoyed", "This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!": "afraid", "Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant, but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts.": "grateful", "Oh, I shouldn't be ungrateful, lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!": "disgusted", "I was so happy!  I have been working so hard for this company since I started so this is a great sign in my opinion!  ": "excited", "Did you get a promotion?": "proud", "Not yet but I did get a raise!

What has you scared?": "terrified", "It's all new to me, I've never done it before": "excited", "It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.": "lonely", "My mother died, I'm a mess.": "sad", "oh dang thats so horrible": "angry", "Thank you :(": "sad", "it gets better with time but it must be hard": "annoyed", "I really miss Hastings.  I spent so much time in that store when I first started college.  Both just hanging out and working.": "lonely", "I remember that store!

But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!": "joyful", "Do you have a large family, or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?": "sentimental", "We don't have a huge family, just 5.  But my wife does daycare, and our current vehicle only has 5 seats, so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.": "impressed", "5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.": "anticipating", "Thanks!  If not, we'll still manage just fine.  It would be nice, though.": "jealous", "I'm scared to go to the cottage": "apprehensive", "It is a big change. What is scaring you?": "surprised", "I don't like bugs!": "afraid", "I hate bugs too.

All the lights were off and when I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.": "disgusted", "Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?": "terrified", "Hahahaha, that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies I had seen!  I let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free.": "terrified", "Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!": "terrified", "I was totally ready for my garage sale": "confident", "You were ready?

I'll be a lot happier once it is over.": "hopeful", "I bet. Good luck to you": "hopeful", "I went to work the other day, and I was the only person in the office.": "embarrassed", "Where you supposed to be there? If so, then that is a nice feeling.": "apprehensive", "Yeah, everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while, but got a bit lonely.": "lonely", "Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. ": "sad", "It did toward the end of the day for sure!": "surprised", "I am starting back at school next month. I am excited about getting back into my classes.": "anticipating", "That's great. What classes are you taking?": "prepared", "I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors.": "joyful", "That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?": "sentimental", "I want to be a software developer I think, so I like the programming.": "anxious", "You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.": "guilty", "I really like school, so you never know what I might decide to go for next. Thank you for the advice.": "apprehensive", "Any time. Have a good weekend :D": "content", "My dog just died in my arms.": "annoyed", "Did that happen tonight?": "terrified", "No, it was a few years ago.": "nostalgic", "Well, it must've been something you said.": "ashamed", "My step-daughter just turned 16 in the past week.": "proud", "Did she have a party?": "excited", "We're actually having it this coming weekend.": "excited", "Does she have her license yet?": "proud", "No . . . that's a long story involving her idiot father.  I'm somewhat glad, though, as she can't seem to set her phone down.": "sad", "Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??": "angry", "Text, video chat, watch some goofball put makeup on, and shop.  Things most teenagers do, I suppose.": "angry", "Does she play any sports?": "surprised", "I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside.": "annoyed", "That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.": "annoyed", "I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)": "annoyed", "It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!": "anticipating", "I was shocked by my present.": "surprised", "You got a present? How lovely!

He also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time.  It was miserable living there.": "disgusted", "So, I take you left to live someplace else?": "guilty", "Haha yes, I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.": "sentimental", "Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!": "annoyed", "I recently tried to get a manager's job in my company, two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job.": "confident", "Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?": "joyful", "I had much more experience than both of them, but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.": "furious", "I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.": "anxious", "My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but he made it through college": "proud", "That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.": "proud", "I was.

It will be great finally living together.": "excited", "Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?": "content", "We have been dating almost a year.  I'm just excited to take this next step in the relationship.": "apprehensive", "It's a huge step, congratulations! ": "proud", "My girlfriends aunt just died.  She wasnt close to her but is still devastated because of the impact it had on her sister.  I'm doing whatever I can to help them both.": "devastated", "Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.": "devastated", "Thats very true.  I know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now.": "sentimental", "Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.": "guilty", "My friend and coworker hasnt been coming into work.  People are starting to talk but its hard to stick up for him when he only comes in once or twice a week.": "annoyed", "Is he sick or just being lazy?": "annoyed", "A little bit of both.

So am I!": "guilty", "One of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up. ": "devastated", "Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?": "apprehensive", "Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!": "ashamed", "That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes.": "sad", "I agree!. I was so proud of her and her test results surprised me! ": "proud", "The first time my girlfriend slept over I farted on her leg in the middle of the night.  She knew it happened but didnt say anything.  She also doesnt know that I know.": "angry", "Thats... uh... strange?": "lonely", "It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!": "embarrassed", "I think so, you're two peas in a pod.": "annoyed", "I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!": "sentimental", "Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.": "faithful", "Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.": "anxious", "A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done.": "prepared", "One time when I was letting my cat outside, it ran out into the streets and got ran over": "embarrassed", "Oh my god!

This year, she has decided to return to public school.": "proud", "That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.": "surprised", "She did miss having a lot of friends. I hope she does well. She starts in 10 days!": "sentimental", "Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.": "disappointed", "This will be my last semester in college! I cant wait to finish.": "anticipating", "Wow good job! SO close": "proud", "THanks!. I get so happy everytime I think about it!": "hopeful", "Thats a great accomplishment": "proud", "I agree.

Not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end": "confident", "So I was out of town this weekend and lent my brother my car. I was hesitant at first, but I felt he would do good with it and take care of it. ": "trusting", "Did he take care of it for you?": "trusting", "He did. I feel I can let him use it more often after this. ": "angry", "That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud. ": "impressed", "Yes I am. I can know rest assure that he will do good. ": "impressed", "My husband works very hard so that I can be a stay at home mom.

I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for. ": "confident", "Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them": "devastated", "Sounds like a plan! She has noticed my work , so im confident it will work out well. ": "hopeful", "My child sneaked in my room to get the Xbox controller while I was sleeping. The night before, I had grounded her.": "furious", "Oh no, do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?": "caring", "I think she thought she could play a few minutes of Minecraft and then return the controller before I woke up! I caught her getting into the drawer where I hid it.": "surprised", "I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.": "embarrassed", "My friend came to my house drunk and threw up everywhere. ": "surprised", "Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?": "disgusted", "Yes it was! I could not do nothing. She was in a raging fit. Ijust made she she went to sleep ok.

Are you taking any precautions?": "confident", "One time I saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food": "caring", "Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?": "nostalgic", "It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant": "disgusted", "Okay, that makes more sense then to me.": "guilty", "We made sure to board up for the hurricane coming.": "prepared", "Where are you located ?": "excited", "We are in Miami, Florida 1 mile from the beach. .": "surprised", "I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.": "terrified", "The cop said I will probably never find out who did it.

People are so inconsiderate!": "annoyed", "My sons teacher isn't very nice to the young kindergartners. ": "nostalgic", "Oh no! Why not?!": "disappointed", "Not, sure, but she is not very nice at all.": "surprised", "I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!": "angry", "I may never know who she was.": "furious", "Never know who was?": "disgusted", "The women that hit my car and left before the police came.": "furious", "Wow that is aweful!

I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!": "afraid", "That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?": "terrified", "There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!": "terrified", "I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia.

I miss going to the state fair, was always fun.": "nostalgic", "When I was in high school, I dated a guy for almost a year. A few weeks before summer, he broke up with me and started seeing another girl.": "jealous", "You must have been sad and angry.": "furious", "I was.

Have fun": "confident", "I bought extra items during school lunch in high school. I have a negative balance on my account.": "annoyed", "Ouch, hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.": "afraid", "I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.": "ashamed", "I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha, its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.": "impressed", "I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.": "furious", "Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.": "angry", "Yeah we tried but he cut all communication, he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness. ": "disgusted", "I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! ": "angry", "So i recently traveled to Cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until 3 AM, and as we were walking back there were these 3 guys hiding in the shadows. We got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn't follow.": "terrified", "Oh wow. That's pretty scary.

Just don't drive if you go, they seriously drive like maniacs haha": "joyful", "I raised 6 chickens since they were babies.

Looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat.": "disgusted", "That is gross, I can't even imagine what that would taste like!": "disgusted", "He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.": "disgusted", "That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.": "disgusted", "One of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it, it was like 10+ feet of distance, really amazing stuff.": "content", "Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt.

": "anxious", "I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha": "embarrassed", "We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!": "embarrassed", "Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!": "angry", "Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.": "furious", "I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight.": "terrified", "Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?": "terrified", "I was tired and wanted to get in bed early,": "angry", "Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.": "hopeful", "Had my finals last week, studied really hard for them. Felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm": "content", "Great, when will you know your scores?": "confident", "Thankfully i knew them right at the spot, i got a 98!": "embarrassed", "Wow, that's fantastic.": "proud", "He doesn;t seem to see the issue.": "disappointed", "Who doesn't?": "disappointed", "My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem. ": "faithful", "What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!": "angry", "I studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a 68 on it.": "nostalgic", "That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?": "disappointed", "Yeah, passed with a 75, not what i wanted but at least i passed": "afraid", "Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.": "embarrassed", "i dropped my groceries in the parking lot": "furious", "Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).": "sad", "i grabbed the cans that rolled away, lol": "afraid", "Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!": "furious", "One of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates 100$ each": "angry", "That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.": "disgusted", "Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy, worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.": "angry", "Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?": "impressed", "A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had \"call ahead seating\" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later, our table was not ready!": "prepared", "That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.": "annoyed", "That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.": "furious", "Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.": "disappointed", "The food made it worth the wait, for sure! Any other restaurant I would have walked out!": "impressed", "We had a new puppy. He loved to chew on everything. I went to the grocery store and when I got back home, the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch. He had chewed through the bottom!!": "grateful", "Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.": "disgusted", "They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.": "disgusted", "Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.": "apprehensive", "I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally.": "annoyed", "That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.": "surprised", "Same here, they're so incredibly important in this day and age.": "sentimental", "It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.": "trusting", "i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door": "annoyed", "Do they run them all day long - or at night?": "annoyed", "during the morning and day on the weekends!": "content", "Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?

What did your neighbor do to get you angry?": "furious", "he was using powertools loud in the morning": "angry", "How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.": "annoyed", "Last Christmas, I saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts.": "grateful", "thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them": "joyful", "Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.": "content", "me too!": "hopeful", "The teacher I had for Calculus 2 last semester was so terrible at his job, I had to learn it all on my own.": "ashamed", "I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.": "surprised", "Same here. Surprisingly, I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!": "content", "Well done.

I am sure you will do well on the test.": "confident", "On my way back from a funeral, my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.": "anxious", "I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere, he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.": "angry", "Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.": "guilty", "Agreed. I was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night.": "terrified", "I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.": "surprised", "Congratulations! Retail really does suck.": "anxious", "Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.": "grateful", "Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.": "furious", "Do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?": "nostalgic", "Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?": "nostalgic", "I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.": "nostalgic", "I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.": "anticipating", "A while back, my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.": "furious", "That sucks.

Why was it a bummer?": "lonely", "I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.": "disappointed", "That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.": "lonely", "After working for a week straight and running a lot of errands, today is my first day off in a while.": "proud", "That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?": "content", "It is, I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch, it couldn't get any better than this!": "anticipating", "Nice!

I can't put it down.": "content", "My older brother always makes promises he can't keep.": "proud", "That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.": "disappointed", "I don't know why.

Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.": "joyful", "My little brother failed his French class and had to spend three weeks in summer school.": "disappointed", "Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!": "sentimental", "French is a really hard language, I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.": "devastated", "Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.": "sad", "My boyfriend's brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle.": "terrified", "That sucks.

I wish I had a helpful family.": "grateful", "Whenever my sister in law plans things, she only does it around her schedule.": "annoyed", "That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?": "annoyed", "Yeah, but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However, we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.": "caring", "Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.": "annoyed", "This weekend was kind of a drag.": "embarrassed", "Oh yeah? Why is that?": "anticipating", "I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.": "lonely", "Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?": "guilty", "I was feeling quite social, though, so it was kind of a buzzkill.": "embarrassed", "The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately.": "afraid", "Are the good memories at least?": "nostalgic", "Oh yeah, but it really makes me miss those times.": "nostalgic", "At least you have those memories.

I feel like thats illegal": "jealous", "I just got some frustrating news the other day.": "annoyed", "What was the news?": "devastated", "My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.": "disappointed", "Are you going to ground him?": "caring", "Definitely at least going to have a long talk about why what he did was wrong. There will be some kind of punishment that's for sure.": "angry", "My sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere.": "faithful", "Why don't you join them?": "lonely", "We definitely don't have money for that, plus there are four of us.": "joyful", "Why don't you get another job?": "devastated", "Ugh.

I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!": "apprehensive", "Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.": "anxious", "I was under the impression that my friends would pay me back.": "afraid", "What did they do to you?": "surprised", "They owed me money but never paid me back.

Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel": "lonely", "I thought about it but no, it's not worth rocking the boat.

What are you doing now?": "annoyed", "Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!": "devastated", "Wow! That's like a paid vacation!": "excited", "Haha that's an awesome way to think about it!": "nostalgic", "Last week a friend of mine won $2000 on a scratch off ticket. I buy those things all the time and never win squat.": "annoyed", "Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret? ": "impressed", "Right place, right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.": "disgusted", "Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!": "jealous", "My niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that's going around": "caring", "That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!": "apprehensive", "I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.": "devastated", "I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. ": "guilty", "My phone went missing. Imagine my surprise when I got a Facebook message \"from myself,\" it was the person who found it saying \"I have your phone.\"": "surprised", "Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?": "afraid", "I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.": "joyful", "You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.": "furious", "Very! Lucky for me it was a cheap phone, I think if I had the newest iPhone or something I would have never seen it again.": "excited", "I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated, just out of curiosity.": "content", "Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?": "caring", "Nah, although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.": "jealous", "Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.": "angry", "My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before.": "nostalgic", "Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?": "caring", "She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.": "sentimental", "I have a 10 year old like that.": "excited", "My daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer. We just found out that she made the team!": "impressed", "that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding": "proud", "It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!": "excited", "that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.": "impressed", "thank you!": "excited", "you are very welcome. good luck!": "jealous", "My grandma threw away my high school yearbooks.": "sentimental", "That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!": "furious", "I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?": "annoyed", "Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. ": "annoyed", "Good suggestion! Really I wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well. I will see them next month for our reunion anyway!": "confident", "We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.": "devastated", "I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February, so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?": "sad", "It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter": "surprised", "I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.": "prepared", "I completely agree. I broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him. I'm not sure if I want to get another dog yet. We have chickens so she's began to show them more attention now.": "devastated", "I bought my daughter her first cell phone. It's a lot of responsibility for her. I hope she is ready for it.": "hopeful", "I am sure she will be smart with it": "proud", "I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone": "prepared", "You can always show her the ways": "sad", "This is true! I also put an app on her phone to block things she's not old enough to use": "angry", "I accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day.": "guilty", "Were they okay?": "surprised", "Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.": "guilty", "At least you're not getting sued": "disappointed", "Oh man, that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!": "disgusted", "Im good at that lol": "excited", "I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear.": "afraid", "Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.": "terrified", "This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared": "devastated", "I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.": "impressed", "Have you ever went. When you looking down from 15,000 feet you get scared.": "afraid", "We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out!": "terrified", "I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?": "lonely", "Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up, it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.": "embarrassed", "I am not sure I would do well in that house": "apprehensive", "It is really creepy! ": "surprised", "After my mom passed away I found all our old cassette tapes in her storage, listening to those was pretty cool.": "nostalgic", "Bet that brought back good memories.": "nostalgic", "Definitely, brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.": "nostalgic", "Where did you guys usually go?": "content", "Everywhere! Sometimes we just hopped in the car and went like two or three hours from home just to do something for the day.": "disgusted", "I've spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend. I'm exhausted.": "confident", "whats the competition on ?": "confident", "Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.": "grateful", "Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further ": "hopeful", "I'm so angry at my self. I was in my performance review today and I passed wind in front of my boss. OMG ": "annoyed", "I wonder how that was noted on your report.": "sentimental", "I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement. ": "devastated", "Sounds like a wacky place to work.": "impressed", "I got a raise today. I've pushed my self hard this last year and I deserve it.": "proud", "That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.": "sentimental", "Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!": "disappointed", "Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.": "proud", "For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.": "anxious", "Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?": "terrified", "I don't think so, it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.": "terrified", "I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!": "ashamed", "I told my daughter she wasn't allowed to watch Youtube because it's hard to monitor. I caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!": "terrified", "Its so hard to monitor that stuff now": "grateful", "It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.": "angry", "Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too": "apprehensive", "I walk my dog for 30 minutes at a time but no matter what, he always ends up using the bathroom inside! I wish he would left me know if he needs to go out.": "angry", "On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?": "furious", "No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!": "surprised", "Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.": "afraid", "That's not a bad idea!": "angry", "My neighbor stole a package from me.": "angry", "No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.": "angry", "So check this out, I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it, the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!": "surprised", "Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.": "furious", "Yeah, I'm pretty livid. I think I will report him to our HOA and see what they say.": "angry", "I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone. ": "excited", "you havent met all three people in the city yet?": "excited", "haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city. ": "anticipating", "ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head": "angry", "It's the most beautiful place you can move just no one here. Me and the animals. ": "content", "My coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week.": "grateful", "What kind of job was it": "proud", "Sales, so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.": "jealous", "Sales do sound hard to do": "confident", "My cat got sick the other day, he was really pathetic. I felt so bad for him.": "ashamed", "Is he going to be okay": "caring", "Yes, thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.": "disgusted", "I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain": "annoyed", "My friend is a single mom who works full time. She just graduated college!": "proud", "That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.": "impressed", "Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha": "proud", "Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.": "jealous", "I think I got my coworker in trouble.": "guilty", "Why? Were they not working?": "afraid", "He called in sick, but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick, I thought he was just out. So, I accidentally told my boss where he was.": "guilty", "He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.": "annoyed", "Thanks, that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!": "guilty", "Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?": "guilty", "Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in.": "surprised", "That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?": "grateful", "Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.": "lonely", "Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!": "joyful", "Drove past the area my Middle school was in today. It was gone. I hated it when I was in school but now that's it gone I'm sad": "embarrassed", "yea funny how that happens": "embarrassed", "It was not even that long ago I went to that school. It's been less then 10 years. They did not even build anything. It's a park now.": "sad", "well at least its being put to good use": "anticipating", "I'm going to job interview Thursday. I'm currently employed but I'm ready to move on.": "anxious", "Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?": "confident", "Yes, I'm currently in middle management this would be the next step up. I'm excited and nervous ": "anxious", "Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?": "jealous", "My cousin passed the CPA exam!": "impressed", "Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?": "impressed", "She's already working at a Big 4 firm so she's just going to stick with that for a few years. I'm proud of her, it wasn't easy!": "impressed", "Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.": "proud", "I just got a new manager at work. She is really young but seems to be full of good ideals.": "anticipating", "That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!": "anxious", "I plan to steer clear. I'm going to relocate in January so I just need to lay low. I hope she does a great job.": "anxious", "lol why do you have to steer clear?": "embarrassed", "I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home. ": "anxious", "ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!": "caring", "The other weekend I really wanted to go out, but I realized I don't have any good friends left.": "lonely", "That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?": "nostalgic", "Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.": "sad", "Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.": "confident", "The other day I was short on cash I needed to pay my phone bill. ": "guilty", "It can be hard these days, money is tight": "lonely", "So true. I lucked out though and found a $20 bill on the ground! I hope the person who lost it didn't need it really bad because it definitely helped me out.": "apprehensive", "I bet that was a nice surprise": "surprised", "I lost my credit card this weekend and then in the worst place Walmart.": "furious", "Did you get it all straightened out?": "disgusted", "Yes I was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it I was very grateful.

": "proud", "Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!": "terrified", "Went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day. Saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt.": "disgusted", "Oh gross, I would lose my appetite": "disgusted", "It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.": "disgusted", "Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether": "confident", "I am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago.": "terrified", "Oh my goodness, that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?": "afraid", "When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones.

I hope fond memories of him get you through this.": "sentimental", "I waited the longest three weeks of my life to get something I ordered online.": "confident", "That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?": "annoyed", "It got worse. When it finally arrived, the box was all busted up and my item was broken.

I guess after years of hinting, he's finally picking up on them! haha": "annoyed", "Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!": "joyful", "haha yeah it does! we've been together almost 15 years.": "grateful", "Congrats <3": "proud", "I had my front door open and a cat (not mine) ran in my house.": "devastated", "Not yours? That is so weird, usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol": "annoyed", "I know! we were all surprised. My god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out.": "afraid", "Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! ": "surprised", "This has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area. This past spring we spent 5 hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area.": "prepared", "That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!": "terrified", "Yes, a lot of people don't have basements, and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark, scary place, especially when the power is all out.": "afraid", "Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!": "sentimental", "I was in the grocery store. I found what I needed on the top shelf. I climbed onto the bottom shelf but ended up knocking everything down!": "surprised", "Oh my goodness, are you alright? I bet you created a mess!": "embarrassed", "yeah!

You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.": "surprised", "I know! I wasn't really planning to do much this year hahaha": "surprised", "Last month, my dog Duke passed away. I got him when he was just a puppy 17 years ago.": "afraid", "I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog": "caring", "Yeah, we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.": "devastated", "That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point": "devastated", "I was driving around my old neighborhood and seen that the house I grew up in had burned down.": "terrified", "That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?": "sentimental", "I spent birth till I was 17 living there, so literally all of my child hood memories.

It was so strange being in our big house all alone without her and the kids.": "lonely", "How long had you been married ?": "faithful", "Just short of 9 years. She met someone online in WoW of all places and just up and moved in with him.": "lonely", "Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.": "guilty", "Back when I was in college, I crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket.": "confident", "I hate to hear that. I hate tickets.

Do you have any way of finding out who did it?": "furious", "No, I called the police but it's almost impossible to track.

That's why I'm so nervous about it.": "anxious", "Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead.

It brings back good memories I had spending time with my friends.": "nostalgic", "Aww, that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?": "sentimental", "The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.

I ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client.": "embarrassed", "Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?": "grateful", "Yeah, my coworker did, but the damage had already been done.

I ended up renting a car because I hate flying so much in just calm weather.": "afraid", "That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?": "apprehensive", "I have, but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.": "terrified", "I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped. ": "anxious", "Last month, this area got pounded with rainfall.

Good luck.": "disgusted", "My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster.": "terrified", "Interesting....did you do it": "confident", "Yeah, but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it.": "apprehensive", "lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end": "guilty", "My husband is so lucky I cheat on him like he did.": "faithful", "Why do you cheat on him?": "faithful", "I could have.

And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking, of course...": "angry", "I happen to come across all his drawings. He is as good as most professional artists! ": "nostalgic", "Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then, huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it.

Talking smack to each other": "annoyed", "You're right I'm going to be even louder next time.": "annoyed", "I dislike a careless driver and this morning I was furious with one by my daughters elementary school.

We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.": "guilty", "You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.": "grateful", "A friend of mine hadn't taken out her garbage in weeks.": "angry", "Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.": "surprised", "You got that right. Also there were so many fruit flies around it, I felt sick to my stomach.": "content", "Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.": "disgusted", "I really hate moving.

I would be so mad.": "angry", "Today I woke from an amazing dream which i had, it brought back a lot of amazing memories, memories which i wish i could go back to...": "nostalgic", "I hear you!

You can do it!": "anxious", "I changed my shift to overnight and walking to my care gave me the creeps tonight. There was a man standing in the dark.": "afraid", "That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!": "afraid", "I agree. I had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine. ": "afraid", "I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!": "terrified", "My brother is going into surgery tomorrow.": "hopeful", "I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!": "confident", "I'm really hoping so! I've been really worried.": "anxious", "I am sure the procedure will go excellently.": "apprehensive", "Today my friend had all of is awe, becasue she won the singing contest at work. She is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing. ": "impressed", "That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!": "terrified", "I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.": "impressed", "That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.": "hopeful", "I hope so. She is very talented. Who would have known. ": "impressed", "I have such a fear of flying, so you can just imagine how I felt when my husband bought us a sky diving voucher for my 30th birthday! He was so excited and I was so nervous and uneasy.": "afraid", "He's a brave man. How was the experience?": "trusting", "Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.  Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time, i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out, it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!": "apprehensive", "It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!": "terrified", "It certainly did.  I would definitely recommend it.  My husband though is another story.  He has a fear of the sea and underwater so you can just guess what I will be buying him for his next big birthday haha.": "terrified", "I was so worried that I could not pay for my tuition this semester. Thankfully my boss decided to give us a big bonus. ": "grateful", "Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!": "joyful", "Yeah and its the last one before I graduate! I can be more thankful for his generosity. ": "jealous", "You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.": "proud", "Thanks for the kind words. I cant be more happy and excited to be done!": "proud", "I was doing a big clear out recently and stumbled accross my old high school year book.  It is a long time since I left school and couldnt believe I even still had it.  Such a feeling of nostalgia looking at the old photos and reading the stories.": "nostalgic", "Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?": "sentimental", "Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those, especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.": "nostalgic", "It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.": "sentimental", "Indeed.  It definitely made my clear out day much more enjoyable.": "nostalgic", "So i just bought a brand new corvette and I let my friend barrow it to go out of town. ": "guilty", "That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.": "surprised", "I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol": "trusting", "I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.": "anticipating", "Yeah it does. I never let anybody drive my car, but I felt I could let her since she is responsible. ": "trusting", "My husband wont be back for a month due to work and Im here at the house by myself.": "lonely", "Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.": "sad", "Yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house. ": "lonely", "Do you get nervous being on your own?": "anxious", "Nah just bored. Im new to this city so I dont know anybody either. ": "annoyed", "Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.": "anticipating", "Yea I agree! II feel so helpless being home by myself. ": "grateful", "Im sure your not though! ": "disappointed", "I had the worst experience last weekend.  I woke up to find someone had stolen my car! I was in absolute shock just couldnt believe it.": "devastated", "Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?": "annoyed", "Well yes.  While i was in my daze, absolutely horrified, my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.": "impressed", "Yeah i would have felt the same way. ": "lonely", "Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!": "furious", "yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.": "embarrassed", "true but in time I finally did see that its not the end of the world, its just a car that can be replaced but that initial overwhelming feeling was awful.": "sentimental", "Today after a long day at work I sat in traffic for 2 hours due to construction on the freeway!": "furious", "That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon": "angry", "Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks. ": "confident", "That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.": "disappointed", "Me too, so i wouldn't have to deal with wasted time!": "disappointed", "My old friend suprised me with a phone call today. I have not heard from her since high school. ": "surprised", "How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.": "sentimental", "Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!": "nostalgic", "That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.": "sad", "Yes the things we remember and ponder about are the greatest!": "joyful", "A little stray pup appeared on my driveway yesterday.  My initial reaction was to contact the local pet shelter.  However no one had reported him.  I decided to take him in, wash him and feed him.  I have never been much of an animal person but I couldnt believe how much i felt for this poor wee puppy.": "caring", "Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?": "sentimental", "I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him, even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward, I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!": "angry", "The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! ": "caring", "Just as he does to us.": "joyful", "I got super wasted. I accidentally messed myself in front of people": "embarrassed", "Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.": "surprised", "Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink": "guilty", "That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!": "hopeful", "I'm really excited for this next weekend!": "excited", "What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.": "excited", "A friend that has been living overseas for the last year or so is going to come back to visit finally!": "surprised", "That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!": "confident", "I had a really scary experience the other day.": "afraid", "That's interesting. Are you okay?": "faithful", "Yeah, I'm fine. My friend got into a car crash while I was in the car though.": "trusting", "That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.": "sad", "I went camping the other day and had a rlly bad experience during it.": "disappointed", "Why what happened?": "lonely", "I ended up getting lost for a bit in the woods which was not fun. Luckily, I made it back to my group at some point.": "devastated", "Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.": "afraid", "When I was a teenager I used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge.  One time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages.  That weekend I borrowed it and of course ripped it!  The next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible.": "furious", "Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.": "ashamed", "oh yes she has, it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!": "guilty", "That's probably a good idea.": "guilty", "Yes just a pity I had to learn the hard way.": "lonely", "My last day of work was yesterday. I got so emotional driving home and I cried.": "sad", "I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?": "disappointed", "Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone. ": "lonely", "Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.": "sad", "Yeah just thinking about it makes me want to tear up. ": "sentimental", "Yesterday I found my boyfriend with someone else!": "jealous", "hmmn, really?..i guess you must have felt very bad": "lonely", "I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.": "apprehensive", "am so sorry about that, did he apologize?": "furious", "He doesnt know I know, but he will soon when i throw his stuff out": "angry", "One time when I was younger I wore a Halloween costume that I'd been looking forward to show off.  But I ended up covering myself up with a cape, because I was self conscious of how I looked.": "embarrassed", "Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?": "embarrassed", "Well the costume itself ended up looking great, since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it, so I felt bad.": "embarrassed", "It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. ": "ashamed", "That's true, but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.": "anxious", "Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.": "excited", "Whom do you belive the most": "devastated", "In reference to what?": "surprised", "Your trustful person?": "trusting", "My husband is my most trusted companion.": "lonely", "Oh, How much did you like him": "proud", "my father couldn't stope any lower, how can someone take money from their own child": "jealous", "That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?": "furious", "i did many times, but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything": "disappointed", "How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.": "devastated", "my wife is always there for me, so i trust her more than anybody and i dont want to have any friends otehr than her, she is my faith": "trusting", "That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends.": "grateful", "that's only normie talk, we are both introverted and we hate people": "afraid", "Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.": "guilty", "i am a joke, i am ashemed of what i did": "excited", "what did you do???": "surprised", "i builied someone because they made fun of my mother, but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can't believe i did that": "grateful", "well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers": "sentimental", "I  waited 3 years for them to realise season 3 and they promised it was to be released today, i was so devastated when i found out that they had to postpone it even more :/ it's just so annoying": "devastated", "stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later": "hopeful", "i hope so :<": "guilty", "it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.": "anxious", "I still have a favorite stuffed animal of mine that I've had since I was young.  It's still in pretty good condition and reminds me a lot of my childhood.": "sentimental", "That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. ": "sentimental", "Yeah, it is.  I always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it's even more special.": "grateful", "That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. ": "sentimental", "a young girl, crying, sadden by the cruelity of our elders, told me about all these feelings i began to cry and became very sentimental": "devastated", "....what feelings? what are you talking about": "guilty", "she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset": "angry", "oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?": "caring", "i am so envious of my sister, she has everything i just want to make her life hell": "jealous", "That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with": "jealous", "yeah but only i should get everything! no one else": "furious", "Other people deserve to have things, too.": "jealous", "i am so embaressed at myself... i cant believe i fell down the stairs and my pants fell and my behind was exposed to the whole crowd ": "ashamed", "Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, \"Safe!\"": "disappointed", "indeed, but this time i was red and yelling in my head": "furious", "Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. ": "embarrassed", "don't you think life is peaceful? are you content?": "content", "eh not really. what about you": "ashamed", "i did, espcially today when i woke up, i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can't just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that, so i decided to work hard on becoming free": "nostalgic", "and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?": "sentimental", "i will work on the things i enjoy, which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often": "excited", "i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors": "joyful", "I've known my best friend since I was 4 years old.  He joined the Air Force after high school and moved out of state and I was really upset when he left.": "sad", "Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?": "lonely", "Oh yeah, we still keep in contact over the Internet daily and visit each other every few years.  But I miss when we used to hang out every day.": "nostalgic", "I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. ": "sentimental", "the future is so uncertain and yet so certain i am so not ready for what's about to come it fills mee with anxiety and depression just thinking about it": "anxious", "Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. ": "content", "i hope so": "hopeful", "If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on. ": "ashamed", "I have been spending a year learning a new skill and after so much study and hard work it is finally paying off. I am feeling faithful again. ": "content", "that is great.. may i know what you have learnt": "guilty", "I have been learning to trade on the Forex markets.": "disappointed", "it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it": "proud", "Thank you sir, have a great day!": "proud", "great day to you too": "content", "i am so prepared the exam tomorrow!": "prepared", "How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!": "confident", "yup but i have been studying since for a year ": "anticipating", "You sound very confident!

We all make mistakes.": "furious", "I really hate going to the doctor. I was hesitant about going this time.": "apprehensive", "Why do you need to go to the doctor?": "anxious", "I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.": "apprehensive", "Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?": "angry", "I was planning on going to grad school and I told a lot of people. I ended up not going, and I felt embarrassed every time someone asked me about how school was going.": "ashamed", "That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?": "guilty", "Yes. Without really giving details, I always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn't work out.": "hopeful", "Right. ": "angry", "I found a picture of my daughter and me from when I took her to a waterfall a long time ago. It brought tears to my eyes.": "sentimental", "Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?": "nostalgic", "Yes she does. Of course she doesn't see the sentimentality of it yet as I do. She is only 23. ": "sentimental", "One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.": "sentimental", "I have the worst fear of carnival rides, i always think they": "terrified", "I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?": "terrified", "(pressed enter too early). I love thrill rides, but i don't trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up, too many horror stories. I mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions.": "apprehensive", "Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.": "furious", "My wife's cousin was sent to the hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma with something having to do with his lungs": "terrified", "Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?": "disgusted", "Yes. They aren't sure what's wrong but his oxygen level is down to 40%": "caring", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?": "anxious", "I was on the highway during a strong thunderstorm, no visibility. I had a bad feeling someone bad was going to happen and no more than 10 minutes later two cars in front of me crash and one gets flipped over.": "terrified", "That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition": "terrified", "Yeah I honestly don't but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen. A lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason.": "terrified", "I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.": "terrified", "Walking to a restaurant the other day and I forgot to hold the door open for an old lady, felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too.": "ashamed", "It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.": "guilty", "I hope so, i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her.": "nostalgic", "It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!": "joyful", "I bought a new phone recently and not long after i dropped it and shattered the screen, first time this happens and it was just terrible.": "devastated", "Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?": "apprehensive", "No I usually don't since i've never dropped mines but I do get warranty now. It wasn't a cheap repair either.": "annoyed", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.": "devastated", "I was disgusted when my dog tried to attack another dog": "disgusted", "Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school.": "impressed", "Not really, but he knows better. I think I will get a trainer.": "trusting", "Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.": "caring", "Saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away, felt nice seeing her on video again.": "nostalgic", "Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.": "sentimental", "Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored.": "guilty", "I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.": "apprehensive", "I got the scores for my final exam. got a B and passed the class, it was a good day to celebrate.": "proud", "That's awesome!  Congratulations!": "joyful", "Yeah, i pampered myself and went with some friends to a Japanese sushi place.": "joyful", "Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate": "apprehensive", "Ordered a new pair of headphones online. They are a really high end pair so I'm very excited to finally get them.": "joyful", "That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones": "excited", "Yeah, it really is a day and night difference. Let's you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better.": "nostalgic", "I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!": "surprised", "My wife is having a hard time after finding out we can no longer have children. I am doing my best to support her and care for her but it is very hard when nothing seems to work.": "caring", "Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?": "excited", "I do but she doesn't. Which makes it harder I think. All I can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal.": "sad", "I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.": "caring", "Back in middle school i had a crush on a girl and one day in class she was talking to another guy. I was jealous for a while but it didn't matter anyways. I ended up getting her.": "jealous", "Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest.": "surprised", "It is, those were the funnest days. No responsibilities.": "excited", "I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.": "nostalgic", "I had a lot of feelings when I found pictures of my dog who has passed.": "sentimental", "It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone": "devastated", "It was very bittersweet. She could not work her legs anymore due to age.": "sad", "You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!": "content", "I moved to my current town one year ago and I really like it here. I'm happy and couldn't think of a better place to live.": "content", "Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?": "content", "It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.": "excited", "That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.": "excited", "Either that, or people are just nosier and love getting into each other's business! Just kidding. I think the slower pace of life just makes people nicer.": "content", "I very much could count on my mom to always be there for me.": "trusting", "That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.": "grateful", "Me too. I am so thankful for her.": "grateful", "Is there anything she does specifically for her?": "annoyed", "I was upset when I failed my math test": "sad", "I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?": "ashamed", "I did, but the material was a hard subject.": "confident", "Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.": "disappointed", "I'm glad I can trust my husband to always be there for me.": "trusting", "That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?": "joyful", "Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@": "anticipating", "That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.": "faithful", "Hi friend! Wow, I was so scared of this taxi driver when I was vacationing in Mexico. He looked rather suspicious.": "afraid", "Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?": "afraid", "No, I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case. ": "trusting", "Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol": "guilty", "Yeah but the car was on the highway and I could not get out. Thankfully everything was alright. Never again though!": "annoyed", "I was storing all of my old photos on my new external hard drive yesterday. It made me wish I could go back and time and see some relatives again.": "nostalgic", "I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.": "nostalgic", "It's bittersweet! Nice to see their faces again, but sad to miss them.": "sad", "I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.": "sentimental", "I lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn't": "guilty", "Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings": "afraid", "I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it.": "guilty", "Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!": "apprehensive", "Sometimes a fly gets in my apartment and I hold my cat over my head and we chase it. She hasn't scratched or bitten me once while we do this!": "afraid", "That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too.": "jealous", "I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!": "surprised", "Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.": "angry", "I babysat my nephew overnight last weekend. He was scared so I let him sleep in bed with me, even though he kicks a lot.": "trusting", "That was thoughtful, sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!": "terrified", "Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool, but he's still very much a little kid.": "terrified", "Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.": "nostalgic", "I'm an auntie :p": "joyful", "My mistake :)": "guilty", "my pet dog is always there for me. No matter what, I can count on her.": "trusting", "I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!": "content", "yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you": "surprised", "I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!": "joyful", "I had a great breakfast this morning. It was delicious and I felt very happy and relaxed.": "content", "Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.": "content", "Eggs, bacon, strawberries, tomatoes, and coffee. So yummy!": "joyful", "Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs...": "anticipating", "I called someone by the wrong name earlier today. I didn't really know them and hadn't seen them in ages.": "nostalgic", "I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.": "annoyed", "They were ok with it, but I hope I didn't hurt their feelings.": "caring", "I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.": "furious", "The other day we were in the front yard, and you won't believe what happened!": "surprised", "What happened? The yard always has mysteries!": "devastated", "My 4 year-old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!": "embarrassed", "Shocking! Has your kid done that before?": "furious", "No!  All of the neighbors were out there, too!": "embarrassed", "I got into an argument with my husband and I realized later that he was right but I never apologized. :(": "guilty", "Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.": "angry", "Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way.": "embarrassed", "You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. ": "guilty", "That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :)": "lonely", "Your welcome! Glad I could help!": "surprised", "I'm unemployed and struggling right now. I feel really bad when people talk to me about their new stuff, even though they're not trying to be mean": "guilty", "I can understand the feeling, I went through a couple of spells like that in the past.

Yeah I definitely find the more I study, the better I do. Funny how that works! ": "proud", "Yeah, but theres a balance. study too much and you just burn yourself out": "disappointed", "True. There has to be a work/school/life balance. ": "disappointed", "My dad got sick for a week and I stayed at home for a week taking care of him": "caring", "Well I hope he gets to felling better.": "caring", "He's better already but he got a real bad fever during that week": "caring", "You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.": "apprehensive", "I drank all the milk in the fridge and left nothing for anyone else. Next week I will buy extra milk for the house to make up for it.": "guilty", "That's very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.": "angry", "Yeah, I have done that before and I got yelled at by everyone. I learned my lesson. Haha": "guilty", "Lol it happens, what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.": "anxious", "Looking through old stuff in the attic and stumbled across my old gamecube, sadly it didn't work anymore.": "nostalgic", "Awww, I never had one, but wanted one.": "jealous", "Yeah i had good memories playing with my friends": "nostalgic", "What were your favorite games?": "excited", "for sure need for speed underground, loved that game": "devastated", "My old roommate didn't clean out his room or kitchen when he left. My school charged the rest of us $100 because of him.": "angry", "Wow, thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?": "trusting", "No, he cut off all communication. Nobody liked him anyways, he was dirty and rude.": "annoyed", "Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again, just loan them $20.": "jealous", "I was disappointed with the score of my final exam. I studied real hard but got a 64% on it.": "devastated", "I'm sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?": "disappointed", "Yea i had a study group I just panicked when i entered the testing room i think. It's not so bad though, i still passed the class.": "afraid", "Well that's good news. I hope you do better on your next test.": "confident", "I live very far away from my family and I miss them dearly. I feel so alone sometimes.": "lonely", "Aw, I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.": "sentimental", "Yes it is quite hard. But it has been my choice to move away. I guess one day I will return but not sure when.": "lonely", "That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.": "confident", "Yeah that is my personality for sure. At least I will have lots of stories to tell one day! ": "anxious", "One time in high school I sat in chocolate sauce! I didn't have a sweater to tie around my waste, so I had to borrow one from a friend.": "ashamed", "Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.": "devastated", "One of the bully kids noticed the sweater around my waste on the warm day and knew something was up. He really tried to embarrass me.": "embarrassed", "Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!": "disappointed", "Recently moved to a new dorm and when i came in the kitchen was a total disaster. Months old piles of dishes in the sink with mold and dried up old food on the stove.": "disgusted", "Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?": "afraid", "I can but they take forever to come and clean it up. I just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won't do it again. Spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox, alcohol, and soap.": "angry", "I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.": "faithful", "When i was waiting for my final grade report to come in. I was scared i was going to fail my organic chem class.": "anxious", "Did you pass?": "confident", "Yeah, got a 73% on the class. Not ideal but better than failing.": "annoyed", "Absolutely. Great job!": "prepared", "I have complete faith in my diet. It makes me feel great!": "faithful", "I completely agree, having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits": "proud", "It's easier to maintain than people realize!": "proud", "Yeah, and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!": "prepared", "I was driving down the highway during a heavy thunderstorm and two cars crashed in front of me and one flipped over.": "surprised", "Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?": "terrified", "Yeah im alright, i was far enough to steer clear of the chaos. The guy that flipped had to get carried by ambulance, but he didn't look very injured. and the other guy was ok.": "devastated", "Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok. ": "content", "My dog died in my neighbors electrical fence last night. I am devastated!! I don't know what to do.": "devastated", "Oh no, poor dog :( I'd be devastated too, i love dogs so much.": "sad", "My heart is broken and I can't stop crying.

He's in a better place now.": "devastated", "Recently, my wife and I needed a babysitter for the evening, and my mother-in-law offered to watch our kids.": "caring", "That was nice of her. Did everything work out?": "trusting", "No, she forgot.  Which, unfortunately, is typical!": "lonely", "Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?": "nostalgic", "Yeah, it worked out okay to take the kids with. It just wasn't quite as relaxing.": "ashamed", "Yeah I thought of that. well, the kids probably loved it!": "nostalgic", "Yeah, they hate leaving mama!  They can take or leave daddy.": "angry", "I really enjoy collecting shoes, and i'm hoping to get a pair of Yeezy's that are restocking this october.": "joyful", "Very nice.  How many shoes do you have?": "sentimental", "i have around 7 right now": "annoyed", "Are they all Yeezys?": "annoyed", "No, mainly adidas Ultraboosts and nike": "excited", "I feel so happy to live out in the country. Nature is the most beautiful thing to experience everyday!": "caring", "That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?": "grateful", "Only about a 30 minute drive.

Sounds idyllic!": "guilty", "Back in highschool when i got my first car, i was so happy and drove it around for a while and it felt so nice being free to roam.": "joyful", "Oh yes.  The first car is amazing": "anxious", "Yeah its a great feeling having someone thats yours.": "grateful", "Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.": "nostalgic", "I feel anxious when I have to wait for people that are late. Why can't everyone just be on time?": "anxious", "I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.": "disgusted", "Yes totally agree! Maybe I should just leave and make them wait. Haha": "excited", "Yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!": "hopeful", "It's really hard to stay disciplined and watch what you eat.": "furious", "I agree, it's something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?": "proud", "I haven't done anything specific with diets, no.  Have you found one that you like?": "ashamed", "I've tried a few, and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.": "proud", "I think that that's a common problem with all of them.": "furious", "\"It was my birthday and my whole family threw a party for me after work. It was so unexpected!": "joyful", "That's so cool! Did they get you anything nice?": "surprised", "They got me a bunch of gift cards to my favorite stores. They are all so wonderful.

I'll for sure be getting a flu shot next year!": "faithful", "That's a good idea. I haven't done that in years. I always feel like I barely dodge a bullet by not getting it.": "confident", "I have been lucky in the past but I dont remember the last time I have felt that sick. I definitely dont want to go through that again.": "disgusted", "Glad you are doing better!": "content", "i have to go out of town, i am not looking forward to flying": "anticipating", "I feel you, but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation.": "grateful", "i keep telling myself flying is safe but I am petrified of getting on that plane": "surprised", "I see, I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight, to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.": "terrified", "My father has been such a great father. He is such a hard worker and loves his family so much. He is such a great man.": "caring", "That's awesome. I was always a daddy's boy growing up.": "surprised", "Awww, yeah Daddy's can be the best!

My dog is dead but I still keep that stuffed animal to remind me of him": "sentimental", "I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?": "sentimental", "He was about 12.  He was my first dog though! He was a sweetheart.  It is nice keeping something to remind me of him.": "sentimental", "I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)": "sad", "I do too! ": "anticipating", "I was hoping to get an interview for a higher position and was told I would get that at least.  However, the recruiter didnt look at internal candidates and by the time it was reported they had hired someone from the outside.": "impressed", "Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?": "annoyed", "My boss said the recruiter is an idiot and just never looked at internal candidates. It was a bummer but I figure I'll look for something else in the company soon": "anticipating", "Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.": "angry", "I was a little upset.  My boss and her boss were more angry than me though so I felt good they were at least on my side!": "furious", "I am getting a new car this week!

We are developing such a beautiful relationship.": "caring", "That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?": "caring", "I think it is a love bird. She thinks I am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when I call her. I have never had a pet bird before.": "caring", "Aww, I'd love to see a video of that.": "excited", "Ok, I will make one for you. :)": "grateful", "I met a cow the other day and I went to go pet her. Something inside me told me to get away. Later that day the owner told me to stay away from her because she is known to attack people.": "terrified", "You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.": "disgusted", "Yes I think so. That probably could have killed me. But I guess it was not my time. I angels saved me.": "annoyed", "Good thing you listened to your gut feeling": "terrified", "I need to go to the grocery store but it is storming outside. Not sure if I should go or not.": "anxious", "Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.": "disgusted", "Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.": "annoyed", "Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.": "jealous", "i came home yesterday, i found my sofa torn up, let's say this I am not very  happy with my pet dog": "devastated", "Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?": "angry", "i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it": "excited", "Yeah, I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.": "jealous", "I am so hurt that my baby goat died. My dogs were playing to rough and killer her. Man I should have stopped it sooner. It is all my fault. :(": "devastated", "Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself, animals like to play with each other!": "ashamed", "Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.": "trusting", "That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.": "annoyed", "I went fishing with my 4 year-old about a month ago.": "anticipating", "That sounds great, I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?": "anticipating", "He did!  He caught 4 fish all by himself.": "sad", "Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.": "impressed", "My dog was stung by a bug.  His lip got huge and looked really funny but I felt terrible for him!": "jealous", "Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?": "caring", "I did end up taking him in. Luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later.  He looked so sad with his big lip!": "terrified", "I bet he did, I'm glad he's okay though.": "caring", "my best friend friend helped me through some rough spots with my marriage and job.

I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing": "sad", "I went out to eat with my girlfriend last week.  It was an awesome atmosphere and the food was great!": "ashamed", "That sounds fun! Where did you go?": "excited", "We went to a greek place.  There were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers. I think we'll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!": "impressed", "Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!": "anticipating", "as I walk through my house, the rooms are empty, There is no one there for me": "afraid", "I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.": "lonely", "that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with": "annoyed", "I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.": "lonely", "I have no children but I have a ton of animals. I love them all so much.

But he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice, and he'd tied an overhand knot in it, too.": "furious", "That's pretty impressive.": "impressed", "I was in a rush this morning and I dressed my self in stained clothes. I feel so dirty today. :(": "embarrassed", "Oh wow, are you going to be in front of anyone important?": "anxious", "Not today. I just feel insecure about it, like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.": "jealous", "Usually, you are the one who notices it the most. ": "surprised", "My cows are finally pregnant. I can't wait for my baby calves to be born!": "anticipating", "wow, that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too, i presume.": "annoyed", "Oh, yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.": "devastated", "very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun": "joyful", "i miss my old pet dog, i feel so empty without her around": "lonely", "Awww, I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. ": "caring", "i know that what makes it harder not having her around, no companionship": "lonely", "Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.": "lonely", "I am so envious of those that can travel the world and get paid for it.": "jealous", "That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!": "faithful", "Yeah, maybe in my next life I guess, haha.": "embarrassed", "Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one.

Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. ": "surprised", "Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.": "joyful", "Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.": "prepared", "I trust the way my body feels to know if I'm generally healthy or not": "confident", "Usually it will let you know if something is wrong.

": "jealous", "Yes, he did want to get paid but I needed to go home and get my wallet. He got angry with me but what could I do? I had no money with me.": "angry", "That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral.

Even after she had a crazy day!": "faithful", "It's good to have a partner. ": "grateful", "My wife took the kids over to her mother's one evening before I got home from work.

I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.": "disgusted", "Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes.

The next morning she threw up everything...it was the worst smelling pile of stuff I've ever smelled.": "disgusted", "Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross.

She does that sometimes, and just badgers you.  I can't figure out what fires her up.": "apprehensive", "It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.": "confident", "My girlfriend is moving in.  I was pretty calm when we first started talking about it.  I'm really excited but there is so much to pack up!": "anticipating", "That's exciting! When will she be moving in?": "excited", "In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast, I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her, its just the move that will not be fun": "anticipating", "Does she live far away?": "sentimental", "My wife and I are trying to build a house, and keep running into delays getting the permits.": "trusting", "That sounds very frustrating.": "disgusted", "It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out.": "faithful", "Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.": "annoyed", "I was home alone last night playing a VR game.  It took a really creepy turn that I really wasnt expecting at all.": "surprised", "It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.  I dont know if you've ever tried VR but everything feels SO real.  It was pretty scary": "anxious", "I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.": "afraid", "a job I applied and interview for a couple of months ago offered me the job. It was unexpected.": "excited", "Congrats!  How exciting for you.": "anticipating", "thank you, when they called, I did not know who it was at first, then it was, wow I got the job": "apprehensive", "That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.": "afraid", "My husband, I think you've met him, he's been having a hard time finding a job recently. He's been in the final two candidates THREE times but no luck!": "impressed", "It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.": "devastated", "Well, he's got another interview on Thursday. I just know he will get that one!": "ashamed", "I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.": "content", "i needed help with choosing a subject to major and my brother helped": "trusting", "What subject did you choose?": "confident", "I chose finance and economics": "prepared", "Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.": "trusting", "I felt ashamed seeing the police officer yelling at the old lady": "guilty", "why was the officer yelling at her?": "disappointed", "She was trying to cross the road and accidentally had her phone fall, the officer thought she was insane": "guilty", "wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady": "ashamed", "My mother has been a caring mom since i got ill a week ago": "caring", "That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.": "caring", "Yah, i feel loved so much": "sentimental", "It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.": "caring", "I had to walk home from work last night after I got off late at night, it was kind of scary.": "afraid", "Sorry about that, you could have taken a taxi": "afraid", "It was a short enough walk, I just stayed aware of my surroundings and got home safe.": "terrified", "good enough you got home safe": "content", "Today I was looking through my childhood photos and writings, it made me a little emotional and nostalgic.": "nostalgic", "Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.": "nostalgic", "I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.": "sentimental", "Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.": "nostalgic", "I slept through a really important class because I was hungover and I failed because of it. I should've behaved better.": "ashamed", "That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?": "ashamed", "I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that, I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.": "embarrassed", "No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.": "guilty", "I had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick. I tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible. ": "caring", "That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!": "surprised", "He did, he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick, it helps to have someone to care for you.": "caring", "Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!": "guilty", "I once got in a really bad accident on my way home from work and it really upset me": "ashamed", "Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?": "embarrassed", "luckily the only problem I had was my neck was sore for a few weeks but nobody else was hurt": "angry", "That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen.": "lonely", "Hi! I had a great day with my emotions with my child going to school!": "sentimental", "Oh that's great, its awesome when the kids go off to school each year.": "joyful", "Yes - this is m child's first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me. You know how it is! Parent life.": "caring", "You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time, haha.": "embarrassed", "Yes!  I'm already enjoying it!  How are you doing?": "prepared", "I just had a weird experience at Wal-Mart today!": "embarrassed", "Wal-Mart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened, I'm dying to know!": "anxious", "Well, I was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  There was a gas station a small walk away though!": "terrified", "Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?": "ashamed", "I didn't have any cash on me.  He got out of a vehicle that had two other guys in it...staring at me!": "jealous", "I'm going to cut to the chase here. Just blurt it on. My DRESS blew up in front of parents and children the other day when it was windy.": "sentimental", "That must have been a very windy day!": "afraid", "I wanted to run and hide.

I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.": "jealous", "When I lived on my own, I found it hard without having any company": "lonely", "So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do? ": "disappointed", "I was used to having family or friends around most of the time in my old place, but then I moved away. I had to make new friends which I found very difficult": "lonely", "Yes, usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends, but eventually it will happen.": "anxious", "I eventually made friends through work, and it is really nice when my old friends come to visit too ": "joyful", "That was really nice of your old friends.": "nostalgic", "I love the gifts that i received last week on my birthday": "grateful", "Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?": "surprised", "A pair of shoe": "furious", "Nice. What brand of shoes were they?": "nostalgic", "I felt a bit sad last week when i saw an elderly man drop his wallet and a kid picked it up and didn't give it back to the man": "caring", "That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?": "sad", "Yeah eventually the kid was caught i told the man and he caught him shortly after": "disappointed", "I'm glad he was able to catch him.": "terrified", "I saw the movie trailer about Paul Walker's life today. It made me so sad!": "disappointed", "Wow, how was it? I have never seen that trailer. ": "anticipating", "It was just sad. I love Paul Walker and his movies. I still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous. In a fast car.": "caring", "Aww, that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! ": "caring", "Oh he did!  I think the one about candy cane and the truck driver was my favorite. I can't remember the name.": "nostalgic", "Speaking of babies, I got to meet my nephews yesterday!": "joyful", "Are they twins?!": "anxious", "Yes!  They are so sweet. I don't even like kids and I really felt my heart warm up to them.": "nostalgic", "Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!": "nostalgic", "The other day something happened that made me want to run and hide.": "terrified", "Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?": "afraid", "It didn't happen to me directly, but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.": "angry", "I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.": "furious", "My girlfriend and I were watching a series on Netflix.  She wasnt home and I ended up watching a couple episodes ahead of where we were at.": "sad", "I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? ": "disappointed", "She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean, I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!": "lonely", "Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them. ": "guilty", "I moved last weekend.  I was really happy once everything was done and it went smoothly.": "content", "That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?": "content", "Yeah, unpacking and all that fun stuff now.  I really like the new place though.": "nostalgic", "That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.": "content", "I'm not in a good mood! My husband got to go to a basketball game. I wish I could have too!": "joyful", "Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?": "jealous", "I have to stay home with our son.  It is hard for us to find a baby sitter for him.": "caring", "Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. ": "sad", "I went to a friend's wedding this weekend!": "joyful", "Was it a lot of fun?": "confident", "Oh gosh yes. I wore a beautiful dress. I felt so pretty!": "confident", "That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!": "confident", "Thank you! I feel like a slob lately.": "ashamed", "It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.": "sentimental", "it is nice to have a loving pet , My dog is always there for me": "joyful", "What a great feeling! You must love your dog.": "caring", "i really do, no matter what happens, she will always be by my side": "caring", "She sounds like a great companion.": "lonely", "Hello!

It's very different from undergraduate": "confident", "I really need to change doctors!": "hopeful", "He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name": "angry", "Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.": "angry", "Me too.  ": "excited", "I was playing a VR game home alone.  It took a really creepy turn towards the end of the game.": "afraid", "I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.": "terrified", "It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.": "terrified", "That would keep me up at night.": "annoyed", "yesterday i ate a whole big bag of M&Ms, i don't feel proud of myself": "ashamed", "Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. ": "sad", "i hope so, i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed": "ashamed", "I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. ": "nostalgic", "We recently got a new puppy. My older dog waits his turn and knows the puppy should go outside to the bathroom first.": "furious", "Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.": "joyful", "It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.": "grateful", "Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.": "trusting", "We've been really struggling with potty training my son.": "proud", "I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.": "ashamed", "Thanks, we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night, though!": "devastated", "That is awesome. I am proud of him ": "proud", "I went out with some friends a couple weekends ago and we met a group of girls. One asked for my number but I told her I have a girlfriend and didnt give it out.": "faithful", "gotta risk it for the biscuit": "guilty", "Haha, I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.": "surprised", " i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping": "ashamed", "i have a presentation due this week, I am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others": "prepared", "It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!": "anxious", "i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others": "anxious", "You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.": "embarrassed", "I felt very bad when my boss did not approve of my work. It just makes me more motivated to work harder.": "devastated", "Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?": "disappointed", "Yes, I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(": "guilty", "I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.": "devastated", "Thank you for your great advice my friend!": "lonely", "My roommate moved out and soon my girlfriend will move in but right now it is just me in the house. I dont remember the last time I lived without any roommates.": "lonely", "Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!": "content", "It does feel a little lonely.  It's weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person.": "lonely", "Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!": "terrified", "I feel so happy when the sunsets are beautiful and I can take the time to watch and relax. It is the best time of the day for me.": "joyful", "Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.": "content", "Yeah, it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world.": "caring", "It reminds you of how beautiful life is.": "nostalgic", "Man the new guys at work were slandering our boss so bad.": "furious", "Wow, that's rude! He won't last long...": "angry", "I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.": "annoyed", "Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!": "faithful", "My sister is having another baby! I can't wait to meet her! This will be her fourth child.": "joyful", "Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?": "impressed", "Only one more month to go. She is about the explode though! Glad it is her and not me, lol.": "furious", "LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!": "anticipating", "Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha": "jealous", "You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.": "surprised", "There was a random dog in my yard yesterday morning.  He didn't look mean but I wasn't sure I wanted to mess with him.": "guilty", "I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary": "terrified", "It was!  I didn't want to chase him off either.  Thankfully he just kind of wandered away.": "anxious", "I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.": "trusting", "I bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change. She gave me too much change actually. I did not realize until later after I left the store.": "embarrassed", "Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it": "angry", "I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.": "guilty", "The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. ": "apprehensive", "So I was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees.  They were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions.": "sentimental", "That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?": "sentimental", "My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch.": "nostalgic", "I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.": "sentimental", "So I lost the ring that my best friend gave me when he moved out of country.  We had matching ones made and it's really breaking my heart.": "trusting", "Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap.": "devastated", "It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.": "sad", "I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.": "devastated", "We had a pretty fun family vacation about a month ago.": "anxious", "Sweet! Where did you go?": "impressed", "We went to a lake not far from here.  We had a ton of fun on the boat . . . nobody else was on the water one of the days!": "nostalgic", "That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!": "anticipating", "I work in tech support.  Every once in a while a customer will want our software to do something it either cant or is not built for.": "furious", "I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?": "trusting", "I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.": "furious", "Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?": "furious", "I had to take my dog to the vet yesterday and I had full confidence they would take care of his problems. They are so good there.": "caring", "oh no! hope all is well with your dog.": "furious", "Thank you. Other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well. Just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed.": "faithful", "Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. ": "trusting", "So we went out to that new BBQ place to eat the other night.  ": "joyful", "BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?": "content", "It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange. ": "terrified", "Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.": "disappointed", "I really loathe meetings.  They're usually so pointless.": "annoyed", "i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)": "anticipating", "That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However, I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!": "disappointed", "lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. ": "disgusted", "Oh man.  I was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy!": "disgusted", "That's terrible! What did you do?": "furious", "I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.": "disgusted", "That's good. I'm glad your alright.": "grateful", "Once in Kindergarten, a pair of my underwear got stuck in my shirt and fell out in the middle of the classroom.": "prepared", "Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. ": "sad", "I was! I thought I was going to get in trouble": "disappointed", "Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you": "nostalgic", "the other day I was looking at old pictures of a car i use to own. I miss that car.": "sentimental", "What kind of car was it?": "afraid", "i was an old Cadillac, reason I miss it, lot of memories of family and friends riding in it": "sentimental", "Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it": "jealous", "i just lost my pet dog. I do not know what to do.": "devastated", "OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?": "devastated", "i cannot find her anywhere, she is missing, it feels like I have a part of me missing ": "angry", "I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.": "ashamed", "It was wonderful not having to worry about my most recent exam, knowing I was prepared.": "prepared", "Good job! How do you think you did on it?": "confident", "I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.": "confident", "That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!": "joyful", "I packed for a long road trip, and had everything I would need to hopefully avoid excessive stops. ": "embarrassed", "Yeah I like going straight to the point too": "guilty", "Definitely. Nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn't pack enough food and didn't plan bathroom breaks.": "furious", "I like when I get places earlier than expected": "confident", "I had a dentist appointment yesterday.  I hate going to the dentist!": "anxious", "I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?": "disappointed", "Yes I had to get a filling in my very back tooth.  THe dentist said I had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if I started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve.   I was scared the whole time.": "anxious", "That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!": "terrified", "My son wouldnt sleep last night.  He kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room.": "angry", "Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?": "terrified", "He just didnt want to sleep. I think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point.": "devastated", "Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!": "annoyed", "My son graduated pre-school.  It isnt much but its that next step in his school career.": "proud", "That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college ": "proud", "Haha, I hope not too soon!  I was really happy, he is growing pretty fast!": "joyful", "College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.": "surprised", "I'm going to a beer dabbler this weekend.  It has been very busy the last couple weeks so I'm really looking forward to drinking and relaxing this weekend.": "anticipating", "That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind": "anticipating", "I think so.  I'm hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!": "anticipating", "I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.": "disappointed", "I'm trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room.  I know he wants to be by me and I can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights": "afraid", "That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.": "furious", "I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!": "lonely", "Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.": "annoyed", "i do love my pet doggy, she is a treat to have": "hopeful", "That is so sweet. What is her name?": "caring", "Angie, i like to give her a warm bath, dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat": "sentimental", "I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.": "caring", "We just got a new puppy.  My older dog knew to let that one out first when I got home from work.": "sentimental", "That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. ": "annoyed", "Definitely not.  I was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!": "impressed", "That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.": "impressed", "I used to have my dog in his crate when I left for work.  Lately I have been letting him out more and more in the house when I've been gone.": "guilty", "That's good. How is it going?": "joyful", "It's going well!  So far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything.": "angry", "That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it. ": "prepared", "I was driving down the road and I almost hit a dog! I was so close. Really scary!": "terrified", "I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?": "furious", "Yes, he came out of nowhere and I slammed on my brakes. My tires skid across the road.": "terrified", "I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.": "terrified", "I finished all the ice cream when I was told to leave some for others. I was just so hungry!": "joyful", "lol, guess you were pretty hungry": "disgusted", "Yeah, now I am scared somebody will find out. I better go buy some more before anyone gets home. Haha": "afraid", "yeah, might wanna go replace it": "sad", "I am the happiest in my life when I am at the ocean. There is just something so special about nature at the ocean for me.": "joyful", "That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?": "excited", "I don't really have a favorite. They are all my favorite! But I prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything. Like a huge swimming pool! ": "anticipating", "Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.": "terrified", "I saw Dubai from the airplane one day. I never went into the city, but wow, it was a sight to see!": "impressed", "i sure it was beautiful": "nostalgic", "It looked like another planet or something. Very sci-fi. Almost scary actually.": "excited", "really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment": "guilty", "I found out that my neighbors eat turtle meat. How gross!!!": "furious", "yuck, how gross!!": "disgusted", "Yeah, who does that? I have three pet turtles so I better keep a good watch on them. lol": "caring", "lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner": "annoyed", "I felt very sad recently when i found out that my mother has cancer ": "devastated", "Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for your family.": "devastated", "Thank you .  Shes a fighter i hope she can push through ": "anxious", "I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!": "ashamed", "I don't have many friends and my family lives very far away. I sometimes feel very sad.": "lonely", "why do you live so far from family": "lonely", "It is just where I ended up in life. You know one thing leads to another and your living a whole knew life.": "angry", "i would like a new life. i totally understand": "lonely", "I heard a really loud bang in the middle of the night. the next morning I found out that it was gun shots. OMG": "afraid", "what? that scary": "terrified", "Someone was grabbed from their home and brought out to the street and was shot in the foot. Guess they wanted to teach him a lesson.": "furious", "wow, a hard lesson": "guilty", "My internet connection keeps breaking! How am I going to get all my work done?": "jealous", "I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.": "terrified", "It always happens when there are electrical storms. It seems to be storm season around here.": "anxious", "Yes.

I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.": "embarrassed", "Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer.

They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.": "angry", "Yeah, it is very hurtful. But what can one do? Get back at them? It just seems like you would go to their level. I guess it is better to just swallow it and move on.": "jealous", "I just ignore them. At some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working.": "angry", "This past week my 3 year old son caught strep throat. I ended up having to miss the entire week at work to stay home with him.": "disappointed", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better. ": "sad", "He is, i hated missing work, but that the sort of thing a person has to do for their children.": "furious", "It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.": "anticipating", "My high heel broke in the cement the other morning and I had to wear them all day at work. Not a good day!": "sentimental", "Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right, my god. Bring extras next time? lol ": "excited", "Yeah, from now on I will have an extra pair in my desk. Everyone was teasing me all day. It was so annoying!": "annoyed", "I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now. ": "embarrassed", "My father continuously gambles all his earnings away even though he has two minors to support.": "apprehensive", "That's very sad, has he considered getting help for his addiction?": "guilty", "Nope, he doesn't care and denies it's an issue. When I found out, I was too angry to look at him.": "furious", "I can certainly understand your feelings, I hope he can somehow fix his habits.": "sad", "My friends and I started playing Halo online recently.": "confident", "Has it been a lot of fun?": "surprised", "Incredibly so. It brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the Xbox 360.": "anticipating", "Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood, such a great game.": "nostalgic", "I feel happy to just stay in and watch a movie at home on a Saturday night. I have no desire to go out and party like most people I know do.": "excited", "I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things, especially if you've partied before already.": "content", "Yeah, been there done that. I don't miss those hangovers on Sunday morning. Totally not worth it anymore.": "ashamed", "That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.": "trusting", "Last month,finally, after years of working towards it, I was finally promoted into senior management at my job.": "apprehensive", "Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?": "hopeful", "Yes it did, and much better benefits. Seems like I finally got to the end of a very long road.": "proud", "Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?": "lonely", "After working for years at a job I didn't like, and struggling in school, I found a new job that coincides with my Major.": "proud", "I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!": "joyful", "Thanks! For the first time in a long time, the future isn't looking so dark.": "anticipating", "That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!": "joyful", "Last week at work, I went to sit down at my desk chair and completely missed it and fell straight into the floor.": "furious", "Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.": "embarrassed", "Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.": "sentimental", "Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.": "embarrassed", "I know I should not feel like this but I feel so envious when I drive through the rich neighborhoods and I know that I will never be able to live there.": "jealous", "Yea, I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.": "lonely", "I have to pass twice a day too. Oh well, I should just be grateful for what I have now. I just can't help that feeling from creeping in though. Maybe I will buy a lottery ticket, lol.": "anxious", "Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.": "jealous", "Last month my wife and I ordered our first new car with a delivery time of six weeks. ": "anticipating", "Oooh, how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?": "surprised", "We ordered a new Ford Superduty pickup. This six weeks is taking forever.": "anticipating", "I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!": "hopeful", "In the 6th grade, a bird pooped on my back during lunchtime.": "prepared", "Indoors?": "excited", "Nah we were having a barbecue outdoors. ": "content", "In the 6th grade? Where is this school?": "prepared", "In Quebec. All schools have a budget for extra-curricular activities and events. We had a barbecue once every year in June with free food.": "joyful", "Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.": "anticipating", "That sounds awful, all schools need a budget for activities for the students. Anyways I had no replacement shirt and I had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; I felt sick.": "ashamed", "How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.": "proud", "Last month, a buddy of mine bought a scratch off ticket and won $4500. I never win anything when I buy them.": "surprised", "Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either": "surprised", "I mean I am happy for him and all, but I wouldn't mind some found money either.": "jealous", "haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play": "annoyed", "Our puppy wiggled out of his leash. He ran toward the busy road and was hit by a car. It was awful": "devastated", "Oh god, I am so sorry. Is he okay now?": "terrified", "Sadly, no. He passed away at the vet a few hours later.": "disappointed", "I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.": "devastated", "coincidence, I too I'm taking a trip but a business one, I 'm not looking forward to flying": "hopeful", "Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.": "annoyed", "a couple of time, but it truly scares me": "terrified", "Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.": "ashamed", "The other day I forgot to take my anti-anxiety medication.": "ashamed", "You have to be more careful next time, maybe you need a calendar to remind you.": "disappointed", "I put an alarm on my phone, I just get so busy some mornings. At least it didn't affect me too bad until the next morning.": "sad", "I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.": "terrified", "I am feeling pretty good after my interview for a promotion at work last week. My boss told me I nailed the interview.": "confident", "That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.": "confident", "Well I have almost twice the experience as the other two candidates, so I have a really good feeling about it.": "impressed", "Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.": "confident", "The other night, drunk bicyclists were following me home and laughing on the sidewalk.": "disgusted", "That must have been a bit scary, You should have called the police.": "afraid", "I wasn't too far from my home so I figured I could tough it out. I was pretty scared however, especially since it was nighttime. ": "afraid", "You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you.": "devastated", "NASA released some free space posters a couple of months back.": "surprised", "Okay! Now that is interested, I would love to see them.": "surprised", "I think they have them up on their website, you should give them a look! I had them printed for a small fee and now they're up on my wall!": "nostalgic", "Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.": "anticipating", "Yup. The poster files are free, you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa, Trappist-1e, Mars Explorers Wanted and \"We Need You\"": "nostalgic", "Free? That makes it even better, I will be getting me some posters.": "sad", "Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!": "surprised", "I hope so too. Thank you so much!": "sentimental", "Yesterday I found a massive spider in my room.": "terrified", "I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?": "terrified", "It ran off somewhere and I couldn't find it, even though I moved most of my furniture. I'm a little scared.": "afraid", "I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.": "disgusted", "There was a chance that it could rain on the day my best friends and I went camping.": "embarrassed", "Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?": "surprised", "It barely did at night, but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! I'm so thankful that it didn't, because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip.": "grateful", "That sounds like it was a lot of fun!": "excited", "looks like we have something in common, when i walk through my house, the rooms are empty. There are no one here but me": "caring", "Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/": "apprehensive", "i know, i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable": "annoyed", "Yeah i would get a pet": "furious", "I was watching over my girlfriend's cat while she went away on a little trip.": "lonely", "That is so sweet of you. I love cats, you must be a caring spouse.": "caring", "I like to think so, thanks! Unfortunately, the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and I felt so isolated.": "lonely", "The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.": "devastated", " Ever since I started taking medication for anxiety and depression, I've been gaining weight. ": "apprehensive", "I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it": "hopeful", "I have, she said I'm okay because I still have a healthy weight. I've been a skinny boy all my life, and I still am but this extra chub has me feeling down.": "jealous", "Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle": "proud", " No matter who comes to the door, my dog barks.": "annoyed", "Its a good guard dog then": "surprised", "In a way yes, but not really. As soon as anyone ENTERS the house, he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him. He's such a nuisance but I love him.": "joyful", "What kind of dog is he": "trusting", "A Brittany Spaniel.": "devastated", "I was driving down the highway when I saw a car in an accident. It seems they hit a cow! Oh my!": "terrified", "Animal accidents can be really bad!": "angry", "I felt so bad for the poor cow. It seems no one was hurt except the cow. :( The car was pretty damaged though.": "disgusted", "At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow. ": "afraid", "my pet dog is getting older. I know one day she won't be around anymore": "sad", "Just cherish the moments": "impressed", "I will, but just the thought of it makes me blue": "surprised", "It will be okay": "afraid", "I put in a lot of effort and energy and I found a new job!": "excited", "What kind of job is it": "hopeful", "It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself. ": "confident", "That is a nice job I am sure": "confident", "I came home drunk from the bar and stole my neighbor's package that was sitting out.": "guilty", "Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?": "ashamed", "No, but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.": "embarrassed", "That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.": "embarrassed", "With all the money I've been saving up, I should be able to purchase an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality system soon!": "hopeful", "Awesome, congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift, is there a particular game you're eager to play?": "confident", "Hmm maybe Robo Recall, a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!": "trusting", "Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!": "excited", "I went on a new bike trail the other day, it was super fun but also a little scary.": "terrified", "Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?": "anticipating", "Yep, exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike, I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.": "terrified", "I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?": "prepared", "Absolutely! And now that I know it better, I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday, can't wait!": "anxious", "I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!": "excited", "I made a new friend at a convention I was volunteering at. I was shocked.": "jealous", "What kind of con was it": "lonely", "Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime, Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).": "surprised", "that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that": "excited", "That's a shame. Anyways, I haven't made any friends in well over a year because I'm awful in social situations.": "lonely", "I participated in a ropes course with my colleagues, we had to learn how to trust each other.": "confident", "That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?": "surprised", "Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall, but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.": "trusting", "Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.": "confident", "I let my little sister go into my wallet and grab my credit card so she can order something online for herself.": "trusting", "Why did you do tht?": "guilty", "She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.": "trusting", "That makes sense, you are a good older sibling!": "sentimental", "Thanks for the compliment! But she's also a great younger sibling!": "caring", " I once drank six pints of beer in a night and ended up getting very sick.": "ashamed", "I would imagine, that is a lot to drink!": "anxious", "It really is. I felt so bad about my actions, but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.": "ashamed", "I get that, well I hope you feel betternow!": "guilty", "I never learned how to ride a bike.": "embarrassed", "My parents never saw the importance I guess. ": "disappointed", "I get that, did your friends know how to ride bikes?": "jealous", "They did, but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.": "terrified", "Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot": "apprehensive", "My girlfriend made the cutest and most touching card for my birthday.": "furious", "Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?": "nostalgic", "I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.": "sentimental", "Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol": "sentimental", "My cat has terminal kidney failure. There's no cure.": "sad", "Oh, I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... ": "devastated", "It really sucks. It's fairly common in cats and I sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn't make it any easier. I'm sorry to hear about your dog.": "sad", "Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.": "devastated", "I received horrific news from a best friend recently.": "devastated", "Oh no,  what happened?": "angry", "They had tried to commit suicide. It was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need.": "sentimental", "That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs.": "devastated", "you know at work, one of my coworker is always singing to himself, it bugs me": "jealous", "Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.": "prepared", "it really is, he thinks he knows how to sing, i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing ": "impressed", "He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.": "joyful", "One time I slipped on a banana peel": "ashamed", "Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!": "nostalgic", "Yep, everyone was laughing at me": "embarrassed", "I'm sorry but I probably would have, too.

The anticipation must have been killing you!": "prepared", "I ran out of laundry soap the other day, when I went to the store I grabbed a brand I hadn't used in many years.": "sentimental", "How well did it work out for you?": "confident", "Oh it worked fine, but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?": "nostalgic", "Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!": "nostalgic", "Right? I didn't expect that could happen with laundry soap!": "surprised", "One time I saw my husband looking at another women": "jealous", "o no what did you do?": "angry", "I slapped him and beat up the other women": "furious", "o no im not sure that was the best response": "annoyed", "I was leaving the bar the other day with my boyfriend and tripped on the step just outside the door.": "embarrassed", "Oh No! Did you get hurt?": "afraid", "Well, physically not so much, just a light scrape on my knee. But man my pride got wounded bad!": "furious", "I bet that was a little embarrassing. ": "embarrassed", "I was a cigarette smoker for nearly an entire decade. In retrospect this is slightly embarrassing. ": "annoyed", "Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it": "ashamed", "Right. Not much that can be done about it now. I enjoy having more money now though for sure!": "content", "That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!": "anticipating", "Being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as I expected it to be. My daughter is awesome!": "excited", "That is great to hear that things are going well for you.": "confident", "Thanks that means a lot to me!": "anticipating", "I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.": "confident", "I was waiting to hear back about a potential job offer, I really wanted the job.": "anticipating", "How long has it been since the interview?": "prepared", "That's the thing, my anxiety and excitement started the moment I first talked to the company, it was driving me crazy. But I ended up getting the job!": "anxious", "Oh well congrats and good job!": "proud", "My friend just won $500 in scratch-off lottery tickets!": "jealous", "Oh that is awesome for your friend!": "proud", "Oh totally. I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious, I hate to admit.": "jealous", "Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.": "jealous", "Well good, I don't feel so bad about it then. I thought I was being a bad friend!": "ashamed", "I took on a challenging speed bike course recently that was above my skill level.": "grateful", "That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?": "trusting", "It actually worked out amazing! I knew going into it that I'd practiced a lot and had built up my skills, so I was sure I could do it even if I was a little hesitant.": "apprehensive", "Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.": "apprehensive", "When I was interviewing for a promotion at my job. I did all I could to get ready for the interview.

It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.": "prepared", "At my job a coworker took credit for a job I had completed. Once I found out, I went straight to my boss and got it straightened out.": "grateful", "Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up": "trusting", "I found them and gave them a piece of my mind. What kind of person does something like that.": "angry", "For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it, most people dont'": "faithful", "We went camping this summer and my boyfriend made fun of me for packing so much stuff.": "prepared", "Aww haha how many bags did you bring": "disgusted", "It honestly wasn't *that* much stuff, I packed it well. But the joke's on him, he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and I just so happened to pack one.": "disappointed", "Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one": "prepared", "This couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night!": "surprised", "That sounds awful!": "disgusted", "Yeah, it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on, every single night? It's really ticking me off.": "annoyed", "Have you tried talking to them about it?": "angry", "Yes, I casually mentioned condo rules on noise and asked them to at least try and keep it down on weekdays.": "lonely", "An actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! I didn't think they still exist.": "terrified", "I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!": "nostalgic", "Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!": "joyful", "I loved that too!": "nostalgic", "I am content with my life. I have nothing to complain about, luckily!": "content", "That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.": "faithful", "Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok!": "trusting", "Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.": "annoyed", "I was cleaning out the attic last week, and came across a box of old photo albums and some of my childhood things. I sat for hours just looking at old photos.": "sentimental", "Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. ": "nostalgic", "It really did. Seeing all those old faces I haven't seen for years. It was a great experience.": "joyful", "Did you share it with anyone else?": "lonely", "I recently applied for a job with a  new company. It would be such a step up for my family if I got it.": "anticipating", "Nice, a step up is always such a relief.

Good luck!": "anxious", "I'm waiting to hear about a lucrative job opportunity, it would pretty much be my dream job.": "hopeful", "That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?": "joyful", "Not sure, hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.": "confident", "I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.": "confident", "Most of the decisions that I made as a teenager were kind of embarrassing in retrospect.": "ashamed", "I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery": "terrified", "I feel it. Most of the bad decisions were fun, at least.": "sad", "Ha YOLOOO": "afraid", "I can't wait until all the trees change colors and the weather starts getting cold. I love Autumn!": "excited", "I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season, too?": "joyful", "Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.": "content", "I don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall.": "content", "I worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed.": "surprised", "Awe, sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.": "afraid", "Well, not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.": "disgusted", "That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!": "hopeful", "The house is all cleaned and ready for my guests. Wow, I was cleaning all day!": "prepared", "I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?": "confident", "Yes, there is no better satisfaction, in my opinion, than a clean house. :) My sister is visiting with her kids. They are staying for a week here at my house. I am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end.": "caring", "I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.": "excited", "My neighbor sits out on his balcony butt naked sometimes.": "annoyed", "That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?": "annoyed", "No but that might be a good idea. It's just an awkward and gross situation.": "disgusted", "I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.": "surprised", "I have fixed up house to the best of my ability. I feel very certain that it will sell very quickly.": "confident", "I certainly hope so,  Why do you want to move?": "lonely", "I am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier. Less house to clean and more time outside. :)": "apprehensive", "That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.": "content", "I feel confident that eating a fruitarian diet will give me more energy and happiness.": "confident", "Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?": "annoyed", "I have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life. There is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit..": "proud", "Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!": "impressed", "I wrote an email to a family member I haven't spoken to in a long time and I wasn't sure how they'd take everything I said in it.": "sad", "Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?": "trusting", "Yep, it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up!": "anxious", "Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!": "impressed", "I get so mad when the local kids throw eggs at the front doors of houses in my neighborhood. It is so infuriating!": "furious", "Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun ": "annoyed", "Yeah! I wish I had the time for it! I am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act. I am going to teach them a lesson! But I love the paintball idea! That is great! ": "surprised", "Yup gotta lay down the law": "furious", "I moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night.": "terrified", "Terrifying! What was it?": "disgusted", "It turned out to be the sump pump, I guess it was old. But yes, it scared the daylights out of me!": "content", "Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?": "grateful", "I did, yeah. It was actually still in working condition but I couldn't stand the sound and I'm a light sleeper. No more scary noises at 3am!": "terrified", "I made a really inappropriate joke about a coworker to some other people I work with and it got back to him.": "embarrassed", "Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?": "embarrassed", "No, but the person who told him confessed. So I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand. He actually wasn't that upset and appreciated that I owned up to it, but I still felt bad for it, mostly that I did it behind his back.": "guilty", "That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.": "ashamed", "I got my work done early on Friday so I got to spend the day trying out a new bike trail on my new bike!": "prepared", "that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?": "confident", "I've only recently started getting really into it. It sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really... satisfying. Calm.": "disappointed", "Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!": "ashamed", "I miss being able to take my children to the park.": "guilty", "How come you can't take them anymore?": "afraid", "they are all grown up.

I hope you did well!": "confident", "I did! I got an A and I am so proud and happy !": "proud", "Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved": "joyful", "the neighbor's dog barked all night and kept me up, let's say I am not very happy right now": "angry", "I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!": "sad", "i understand the dog is being a dog, but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it": "disgusted", "Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them": "annoyed", "My cat somehow figured out how to open the cabinet and stole a bag of treats.": "disappointed", "Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.": "proud", "Right? I wasn't even mad about it, I was astounded by his ingenuity.": "angry", "That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.": "impressed", "Well he also taught himself how to use a toilet so who knows!": "impressed", "I feel like my husband is the sweetest man in the world": "caring", "That is great! Hopefully he continues to be": "lonely", "I think he will. He puts up with me, and sometimes i can be a pill!": "apprehensive", "Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even": "disappointed", "I was so upset when I had to put my dog down last month": "sad", "Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?": "sad", "Not really. She was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs. It was very sad.": "devastated", "I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.": "lonely", "During my first year in grad school, my basement apartment flooded. EVERYTHING was destroyed and I had to start over fresh.": "devastated", "That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?": "devastated", "Thankfully, yes!! It took several months to replace everything that I could -- but even things, so many things I just simply couldn't replace. ": "devastated", "Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. ": "disgusted", "I am in charge of booking meeting rooms for outside companies at my job. Last week, I made a big mistake and accidentally gave a group a room for free when they should've paid $100.": "joyful", "Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!": "ashamed", "Thankfully, not too much! I was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and I managed to mess that one up so badly!": "embarrassed", "To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!": "guilty", "My brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight.": "excited", "Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?": "anticipating", "I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun, we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.": "excited", "Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.": "prepared", "Thank you so very much! I appreciate the sentiment.": "sentimental", "I drank a lot and told my girlfriend that I would definitely sleep with her best friend if she was down to do so.": "guilty", "What was her reaction to that": "guilty", "She was a little sad and surprised, but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless, I felt very ashamed the next day.": "annoyed", "I am sure she will forgive you": "guilty", "She already has. We both think of these type of things so all is good.": "grateful", "My husband and I have been watching TV together each night--once the baby is asleep, of course.": "content", "That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time": "nostalgic", "It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together, just us. ": "content", "Have you ever passed out together watching tv?": "surprised", "Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point!": "apprehensive", "How old is your baby?": "joyful", "8 months old - but by looking at him, you'd think he was a two-year-old. Thanks for asking!": "sentimental", "And how long have you been married?": "faithful", "My wife and I found the perfect house for sale and we excited to put a bid in on it.": "hopeful", "that is exciting! will it be your first house?": "excited", "Well it would have been, but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.": "surprised", "that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one": "devastated", "I let my friend watch my dog last weekend.": "trusting", "You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?": "trusting", "It was good, he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!": "surprised", "Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?": "trusting", "Absolutely. He has proved himself to be trustworthy when it comes to important stuff.": "impressed", "I once almost ruined my husband's master's thesis presentation--something he needed to pass to get his degree.": "disappointed", "Oh no, what did you do?": "guilty", "I started coughing--badly. He and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay. He was so distracted after that!": "sad", "Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.": "annoyed", "I was expecting a surprise birthday party today.": "surprised", "Lol that makes a lot of sense?": "apprehensive", "Yeah I had a few hints.

It was wonderful!": "surprised", "well that sounds fun!": "joyful", "It really was. I was so happy!": "joyful", "Last week while my wife were out for dinner at a restaurant, I got up to use the restroom and walked by the kitchen. I saw a cook pick up a piece of chicken off the floor and put it back on someone's plate.": "disgusted", "Haha caught red handed!": "devastated", "We proceeded to leave the restaurant, but not after informing the manager, very loudly, about the incident. ": "faithful", "Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service": "disgusted", "I hope I do well when I start school soon, I can't help but think it will be too hard.": "lonely", "Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.": "anticipating", "Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.": "confident", "Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!": "disappointed", "Thanks lol. I wish I could type this well at 6 years old.": "nostalgic", "My husband's been searching for a professional job but can't seem to land one after interviewing.": "confident", "Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?": "jealous", "Well, he has a masters degree and graduate certificate already. He's had a fourth interview for a position last Thursday -- so we are hoping this one will finally be the one!": "anxious", "That is a good news. I hope he get it.": "impressed", "Last month my son had to have surgery to have his tonsils removed.": "proud", "Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young": "terrified", "Yeah, I was terrified. I just wandering around the waiting room the entire time till they came and told me everything went fine. Seemed like it took days.": "apprehensive", "I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still": "anxious", "Isn't it nice when people bring you food, when you've had a long day?": "caring", "Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day": "ashamed", "Exactly! My boyfriend brought me dinner the other night. I had no groceries and just didn't feel like going out after a long stressful day. I was so thankful.": "grateful", "Were at work today or doing something else?": "furious", "My little sister has been going all across the country this summer, spending lots of time on money on pop concert after pop concert.": "surprised", "Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?": "impressed", "Mostly I'm a bit frustrated that she's got so much money to blow on these concerts! And to travel all across the country!": "jealous", "Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.": "jealous", "During this past spring during a bad storm, we had a tornado touch down in my neighbors yard.": "prepared", "Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!": "terrified", "It sounded like a train going by the house from the basement. Thankfully no one was hurt.": "afraid", "Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.": "terrified", "I don't like joining it when people talk about someone that's not there, just like what happened yesterday.": "surprised", "Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened? ": "afraid", "He was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes. While I may agree I just don't like talking behind someones back.": "annoyed", "Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that. ": "surprised", "Yeah I feel like not everyone is as moral as me. But that's pretentious which is ironically amoral.": "afraid", "I work at a library cataloging materials and am often asked to help my coworkers--it makes me feel like an expert, though I'm not.": "surprised", "Sounds like your co workers respect you then": "trusting", "They seem to. Or, at least, they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions!": "lonely", "Or that as well ha": "devastated", "When I was a young kid, I stole some comic books from the local grocery store.": "ashamed", "Did you ever get caught?": "ashamed", "My mother found out and made me walk them back into the store and give them to the manager. That was a humbling experience.": "angry", "Was she disappointed?": "guilty", "When I went into labor with my son, it was quite the ordeal. He came before he was supposed to.": "disappointed", "How many month earlier he came?": "joyful", "It was actually only a week--but he wasn't showing signs of being physically ready was the problem. Thankfully, I'd already had my bags packed for weeks so we went to the hospital ready!": "prepared", "Is he healthy?": "caring", "In the end, yes--growing too big is actually his problem now!": "content", "One time I studied all night for my final exam!": "prepared", "whatwas the exam for?": "ashamed", "It was for Organic Chemistry": "surprised", "tha is really cool what was your grade": "proud", "One of my coworkers has been arguing with his supervisor a LOT lately.": "annoyed", "What are they arguing about?": "furious", "Everything and anything.
