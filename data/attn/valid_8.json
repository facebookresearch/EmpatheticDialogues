I was so suprised. I thought i was got. Turns out, it was my son. ": "surprise", "That's funny, hope he didn't give you a heart attack.": "sadness", "I may have let out a scream that will have him question my manhood for the rest of our lives, lol. ": "anger", "I would probably scream also.": "fear", "I'm overly excited because will be flying outside the country for the first time tomorrow.\".  Please enter here...": "joy", "Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going? ": "joy", "Traveling to South Africa then to Ghana. Also my first time visiting Africa": "joy", "You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels! ": "joy", "One time, I was holding my son over my head, when all of a sudden, he threw up all over my face. I almost cried.": "sadness", "Thats horrible, hope he is ok.": "sadness", "yeah, he had just drank a bottle, and I was moving him around like an airplane. In retrospect. I deserved it.": "sadness", "I see, glad he is ok.": "trust", "Hello": "sadness", "Hi, how are you?": "sadness", "Im doing great i just wanted to tell you a short story about a time i helped an elderly lady.  She was struggling to carry her bags from a trip she had took.  I helped her carry them to her door ! Pretty good feeling when you help others ": "trust", "That was kind of you, I am sure they appreciated that!": "trust", "I went to the Kemah boardwalk with my boyfriend. It made me think of times I went vacationing with my family.": "joy", "My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!": "sadness", "All I thought about was being at home again and being able to relive those moments.": "sadness", "Yes I love to reminice": "sadness", "My dog died a few years ago after I had my son.  It was right around Christmas and I had the dog for fourteen years.": "sadness", "Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?": "sadness", "The dog was there with my throughout my life. He saw me through boyfriends and friends.": "sadness", "I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?": "sadness", "hello": "sadness", "Hello How are you and what is your story chat about today? ": "sadness", "I locked my keys in my car about a week ago. It was 95 degrees outside and I was at the store getting groceries.": "joy", "OMG wow.... i hope you got it open quick! ": "sadness", "luckily there are police who patrol around the mall on the other end of the parking lot. one of them got it open for me": "anger", "Hi, a few months ago, my mother found some stray dogs that were starving, so she told us about them. Of course, we brought the poor babies to our house, a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet.": "trust", "Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in ": "sadness", "Yes, I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets, so I wasn't going to keep them, but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together.": "trust", "I wanted to let you know recently i saw a younger man helping an old lady who fell to the ground. Its nice to see people helping others": "trust", "That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet. ": "joy", "yeah it made me feel great :)": "joy", "Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. :)": "surprise", "So this one time my grandmother gave me a scooter, it was the best gift ever, I was really happy": "trust", "Thats sweet that you remember that, how old were you? ": "sadness", "I was around 10 years old I think, it was quite a long time ago for me now haha!": "sadness", "I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p ": "sadness", "Hah appreciated, have you ever received a fun gift?": "trust", "I was extremely lucky when my girlfriend said she would date me, she is my world now.": "trust", "That's wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?": "trust", "We have been together for close to 5 months now, so not very long haha!": "joy", "Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!": "sadness", "I hope so haha, are you dating anyone?": "sadness", "I started a new job about a month ago and it's going really well.": "joy", "congratualtions. what do you do?": "surprise", "I work in I.T. for the provincial government in Canada :)": "joy", "oh wow. we're practically neighbors.": "fear", "So my friend built a deck and it turned out amazing, I didn't know he had it in him.": "surprise", "How big was the deck?": "joy", "I think its probably about 20 feet by 25 feet? I'm bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah": "sadness", "Wow that is big.": "sadness", "My girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot.": "surprise", "What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.": "fear", "Well, when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish, I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.": "anger", "Oh wow, I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.": "sadness", "I have to fill out forms all day so I scripted a program that does half of it for me and it works really well!": "joy", "Thats great. Did you create the script?": "joy", "Yeah, had to google a bit of it but it worked out well.": "sadness", "I love google. It is my favorite search engine.": "joy", "I was extremely relieved when I found out my dad beat cancer.": "trust", "Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear? ": "sadness", "About 2 years now.": "sadness", "Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :) ": "joy", "My girlfriend hasn't talked to me in a few days and I'm struggling to keep it together but I am at the moment.": "trust", "Have you tried to call her?": "sadness", "I have, but she's going through a rough time and likes to seclude herself.": "surprise", "Maybe give her space.": "anger", "My grandma gave me a stone and said it was my birthstone and I hold it very close to my heart now.": "sadness", "What birthstone is it.": "sadness", "It is amethyst.": "anger", "What birthstone is it?": "sadness", "I play some competitive video games and I think I'm pretty good at one of them.": "joy", "I love to play Madden.": "joy", "Do you play Madden often?": "fear", "Yes, every day.": "joy", "I haven't been able to talk to my girlfriend in a few days and it's making me quite sad.": "sadness", "Where is she?": "joy", "She's in the same city as me, but she's going through a hard time and has decided to seclude herself so I can't reach her.": "anger", "Just give her space.": "anger", "My daughter is very smart. She learns things really quickly.": "anger", "Thats great.": "joy", "Yes, she picks up on things that I didn't even think she knew about.": "sadness", "Did you teach her?": "surprise", "I can't believe how big the waves are. Hurricane Chris amped up my summer.": "joy", "Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!": "fear", "Yes, I've been surfing for ever. Only three of us in the water. ": "joy", "That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. ": "joy", "You are never to old to start. I'm teaching my mate and he is 70 I think. Hopefully I have a boat soon.'": "sadness", "Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!": "sadness", "I usually hate to ask for help, so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help. ": "trust", "Wow, 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.  ": "joy", "That is so exciting, congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family, so having a great group of friends is really important to us. ": "joy", "Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? ": "joy", "Get involved in something. Church, a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups, for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!": "sadness", "I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. ": "anger", "I went to this thing called a Paint Night and I ended up making an okay looking painting": "joy", "That sounds fun, I was never any good at painting": "joy", "I am not either, but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)": "anger", "That probably helps a good deal!": "trust", "That Jerk, Did'nt even wave when he cut me off. ": "anger", "I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!": "anger", "After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy. ": "sadness", "That is terrible, he could have hurt the horse!": "sadness", "That's what me the most mad. It's like he did not care at all. ": "anger", "So I got a new job recently, and I got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what I was expecting!": "surprise", "Nice, congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?": "joy", "It's pretty good so far, I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!": "joy", "Awesome, I hope the job goes great for you!": "joy", "When I was a little girl, our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn't think he would come home so we adopted another kitten. ": "trust", "Thats sad, hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you": "sadness", "Well, we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home, or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.": "sadness", "Haha thats crazy, I hope they became best friends, I love cats.": "trust", "I really liked having my mom here. She helped with the kids but then when she left I missed it.": "sadness", "I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!": "sadness", "Yes, the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.": "sadness", "Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.": "sadness", "This one time I spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys.": "anger", "An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.": "fear", "Its really not, the foods not worth that long of a wait.": "sadness", "I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.": "sadness", "I went to a nice work dinner with my husband. I can't get over how stupid I made myself look. ": "sadness", "Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?": "sadness", "I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday. ": "sadness", "Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.": "sadness", "A lady was having issues with a program on her computer, and I solved it with no problems!": "joy", "That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!": "joy", "That sounds unpleasant, did you get in afterwards?": "disgusted", "Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?": "joy", "I'm so angry they end up charging me 255 in charges that did not belong to me.  ": "anger", "Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen.": "anger", "I called them and did not hold back. ": "sadness", "Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.": "anger", "I was going to go down and go nuts but my wife stopped me. ": "sadness", "My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired, but she got one right off the bat!": "anger", "It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?": "sadness", "I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.": "anger", "That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?": "sadness", "My girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital, and I go and see her as often as I can.": "fear", "I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.": "sadness", "Thanks, I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can, she's my world.": "trust", "She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!": "trust", "I love going to places that I explored and play at as a child. Every time I go, I always feel super nostalgic.": "sadness", "I am very nostalgic too, that must be a fun time!": "sadness", "Yes, until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there, and you start feeling old": "sadness", "That is true, but it is part of life, but it is cool to see things again, regain perspective": "joy", "I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend, but when my girlfriend first moved into my house, I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way, and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.": "fear", "I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.": "sadness", "I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath, and realize its just things, and it was just me being reluctant to change. ": "fear", "Yes, sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!": "joy", "I always hate thinking that my son is getting old. Just like a few days ago, I was looking at some of my sons old clothes, and it made me very sentimental. I never want him to get old on me. ": "sadness", "I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life": "sadness", "Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it. ": "sadness", "True, and the good thing is that when the kids grow, they provide moral support to parents.": "trust", "I love a good surprise like anyone else; however, when my girlfriend waited until 8 pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present, I was caught off guard. I thought she had forgot. ": "surprise", "Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!": "sadness", "She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.": "sadness", "Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!": "joy", "I work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day, Not Fair!": "joy", "Is he a stay at home father, or does he just not want to work?": "anger", "He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.": "anger", "I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.": "anger", "Doubtful, he's a punk!": "anger", "So the other day was my 23rd Birthday! I had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room, a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off, and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! It was such a shock, and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience! ": "surprise", "Must of been pretty surprised, Also great to have friends like that.": "surprise", "It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake, chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery! ": "surprise", "That must of just made everything even better!": "joy", "Right?! I mean who doesn't love cake. But that's not even the best part. on the counter, there was a HUGE pile of presents calling my name. ": "surprise", "I'm thrilled. I got a raise!": "joy", "That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.": "joy", "Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.": "surprise", "You are very lucky": "trust", "Your not kidding and to think I was going to quit. ": "surprise", "Have you seen the film \"within\" on netflix? The other night my boyfriend and i watched it and I had trouble sleeping afterwards, it was pretty creepy!": "fear", "No I haven't actually, I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. ": "anger", "Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out \"within\"!": "sadness", "I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time, but if I do I will definitely check it out!": "joy", "I spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat": "sadness", "Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?": "sadness", "Very! It was a dark maroon stain. ": "fear", "Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.": "surprise", "My wife is angry and I don't know what to say. My anniversary was yesterday and I had no clue!": "anger", "Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations, which of course only makes it worse!": "anger", "I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance. ": "anger", "What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing \"your\" song?": "anger", "I used diamond earrings. ": "sadness", "So the other night my boyfriend and I were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm I coudn't help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away.": "anger", "You should not be so insecure like that.": "anger", "Its not about insecurity! ": "anger", "What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?": "anger", "Have you ever been to Las Vegas? ": "joy", "yes, several times.The place is magical.": "joy", "I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!": "joy", "Well, you are about to have the fun of your life, but gamble responsible.": "joy", "I was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night, it had left me in absolute shock. I did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose.": "surprise", "Why. Did you started dating recently or something": "sadness", "No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!": "sadness", "The most important thing is what you want.": "trust", "I'm one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach. I ride giants.": "joy", "Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?": "surprise", "Yes, you can google me.": "sadness", "Are you still competing on a professional level?": "joy", "Nope, I've got a family now to support so I surf less and work more. But I've still got killer moves. ": "sadness", "I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger.": "anger", "NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously, I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!": "anger", "It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.": "anger", "Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?": "sadness", "A bowl of dry cereal. ": "anger", "Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!": "sadness", "Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.": "sadness", "I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!": "sadness", "Have you ever participated in any races, half or full marathons? ": "joy", "I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?": "sadness", "I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon, it was inspirational!": "surprise", "That's great for her. ": "joy", "I am not afraid to admit this: I am 32 and afraid of the dark. The other day, my electricity went out due to a storm. It was dark, I couldn't find my phone or a light, so I screamed for my girlfriend to wake up. Am I embarrassed to say that, not at all, lol": "fear", "hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?": "fear", "I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is, I don't even believe in the supernatural, so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it, I think. ": "fear", "OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?": "fear", "Nope. I am just scared that in case there is the supernatural. It makes sense in my head;however, when I am saying it out loud, it doesnt, lol": "fear", "Before I applied at Inline I really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in.": "sadness", "That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?": "sadness", "I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..": "joy", "Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!": "fear", "Thank you!  I really enjoy this position a lot so I am happy it turned out well.": "joy", "My husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state I felt really lost and alone for a bit.": "sadness", "I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?": "anger", "Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.": "sadness", "Maybe one day if you have the time, you can pay him a surprise visit.": "sadness", "That is a good idea! I'll have to sneak his work schedule and give it a try.": "anger", "I made it on time to the bus stop.": "disgusted", "That is good. Where you running late": "joy", "I was running late and so did the bus.": "disgusted", "That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind": "anger", "So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad.": "sadness", "I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!": "sadness", "Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.": "sadness", "I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.": "sadness", "I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.": "anger", "Sounds like a good idea.": "sadness", "I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however, that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water. ": "sadness", "Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! ": "sadness", "Yes! I start swimming lessons next week. I have went 32 years without knowing how to swim, and that one visit changed all that. ": "joy", "That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.": "joy", "Oh today I heard one of Nannie's favorite songs on the radio.  It made me really miss our car rides together.  ": "sadness", "Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.": "trust", "She was a lovely lady indeed!  I miss our time together a lot especially when I hear the music she used to listen to.": "sadness", "I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her, that way she'll always be there in some form.": "sadness", "Do you go visit some place that makes you miss growing up?": "sadness", "Yes, I love to visit the zoo!  ": "joy", "I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.": "sadness", "What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?": "joy", "I played Football all 4 years, used to Skateboard in the parking lot and hang out in the auto shop. The good old days.": "sadness", "My mother was always there for me when I was sick, annoyed and sad": "sadness", "That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.": "trust", "Well my dad too but my mum was so much more, even when I was naughty she was still there.": "sadness", "My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.": "joy", "When I was little I got chased by a large dog and now that I'm much older the feeling is still the same. ": "fear", "That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?": "fear", "I am, everytime I see a dog, I begin to run the other direction instantly": "sadness", "You need to fight your fear": "fear", "I actually have no friends, can you believe that? I'm ok with it though.": "sadness", "wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!": "sadness", "No, it's not sad. I really like to be alone, as i'm an introvert. I need my space.": "sadness", "Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family ": "sadness", "Well in that case, I have a few friends. Outside of family, I don't. ": "fear", "Do you ever find it hard to see at night when it's raining?": "sadness", "Yes I do actually, I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. ": "fear", "That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.": "fear", "I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. ": "fear", "Thank you. I've never been in a traffic accident. Thank goodness for that.": "sadness", "I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving, an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind": "sadness", "Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!": "surprise", "I was, it saved me a lot of problems": "joy", "I bet, losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!": "anger", "I written down my notes on a double sided A4 paper, now I just have to wait for the exam which will begin in the next 5 minutes.": "joy", "Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied. ": "joy", "Oh I did, I have been doing it for weeks!": "joy", "Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released! ": "joy", "An employee who had not been working as long as me received a promotion": "anger", "Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!": "sadness", "I definitely did not feel appreciated": "trust", "I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.": "sadness", "When that happened to me, even the teacher couldn't stop herself from laughing. ": "sadness", "That is hilarious. I bet.": "sadness", "I was so awkward and quiet in school, how about yourself?": "sadness", "Oh my just the opposite LOL": "joy", "So you were outgoing and popular, huh?": "sadness", "I can't wait to December when my first born arrives into the world. I'm going to make sure they have a great life.": "joy", "Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.": "joy", "Thanks I'm stressed, excited and hopeful for the future.

": "anticipation", "I was just speaking with my buddy. He is very over wight and somehow finished a marathon last weekend. Impressive!": "joy", "wow yes it is ": "joy", "I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.": "surprise", "He probably stored that up for his energy for the race": "surprise", "I guess, I;m sure he eat again after that. He loves food. If he can do it I know I can run one.": "disgusted", "My friend stayed awake for 36 hours studying for the MCAT! ": "joy", "Haha oh wow, how was that for them": "sadness", "she did well actually, i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!": "surprise", "Thats great, im glad she did well": "joy", "I was commuting to work and a driver cut me off": "joy", "I hate it when that happens! were you ok?": "anger", "I made it out ok, just so irritating": "anger", "I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.": "anger", "I was busy due to work and visited my family for the first time in awhile": "sadness", "That sounds nice! DId you have fun": "joy", "It was great, felt refreshing to be around them": "joy", "I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, it is important to make time for family.": "joy", "I get so annoyed with people who say one thing and do something else. My boss is one of those people. I wish there was just instance that I could be like this is where he annoyed me, but that isn't the case. It happens every day. ": "anger", "I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that": "sadness", "Yeah, it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around. ": "sadness", "Sounds like the best thing to do honestly": "trust", "I have an 8 hour shift in the office today but i can't wait to go home to see my boyfriend! ": "joy", "you will survive, and you have something to look forward to": "sadness", "exactly, it's keeping me going since i'm not feeling to good today!": "sadness", "i hope your work day goes by fast": "sadness", "When I was 12, I got ran over by a truck. I was with my older cousin and his car messed up. Since he was my hero, I listened to everything he said, so when he told me to get the truck rolling and jump in. I listened. however, my 12 year old legs didn't make it and got trapped under the truck": "sadness", "Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.": "fear", "Well, he was 17 at the time, so in his defense, he just was being a \"dumb teenager\". My parents never let me go with him again after that though. ": "sadness", "I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?": "sadness", "I only got a B- on an assignment i worked really hard on recently, but i'm working even harder now studying to ace the exam! ": "joy", "Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?": "sadness", " I do actually! ": "joy", "Congratulations! Studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?": "joy", "I was inspecting rooms yesterday when I bent down to look under a bed, I felt the back of my pants tear. The hole was the entire back of my pants. ": "sadness", "Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!": "sadness", "Yes, I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole. ": "sadness", "Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!": "anger", "That would have been nice. But home is an hour each way. ": "sadness", "I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car.": "trust", "Oh that sounds so scary!": "fear", "It was very scary, i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?": "fear", "I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.": "fear", "So as I've gotten older over the last 10 years. I gained 30 pounds. My wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed I have a bowl of ice cream. ": "sadness", "Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted": "sadness", "yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.": "sadness", "Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.": "sadness", "I think I'm average. I'm 5'11\" 190. It could be worse. I still exercise a lot. Perhaps I need to enjoy the ice cream more and try to feel less guilty.  ": "sadness", "Did you ever attend college? I just completed my bachelor's degree and I'm feeling really good about my future!": "joy", "Yes, I have an Associate's in Nursing.": "sadness", "Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others! ": "trust", "Yes, it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!": "joy", "Have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? Because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want's us to use feels like. ": "anger", "Holy smokes! Let me guess, better for the environment?": "fear", "yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.": "sadness", "You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet, but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!": "joy", "I'm going to have to start waiting until I go to work to use the potty.": "fear", "I scored a 95 on my promotion exam, I was upset that I missed one question.": "sadness", "But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!": "joy", "Thank you, I am definitely proud! When was your last exam?": "joy", "Oh, it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)": "fear", "On the way from work I hit 155 in my VW on the Autobahn. I was well impressed with the car.": "joy", "I love the Autobahn.": "joy", "I've been faster in my old Audi but this little car is a 4 cylinder and still super fast.": "anger", "Yes I use to own an Audio.": "sadness", "Awesome, it's time to buy another.": "joy", "Last weekend I did something big. I finished my first 125 mile Iron man race. I'm still pumped.": "joy", "I have never done that, good job.": "joy", "That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again.": "sadness", "You should. When is the next one.": "sadness", "This fall. I'm need to train more. It was a 26 mile running race, 10 mile swim and the rest on bikes. So much fun!": "joy", "Last night I was looking at my things I have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things. The good memories came flooding back.": "sadness", "Oh wow thats cool.": "joy", "Yes, he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long. ": "sadness", "Thats good you still think of him.": "sadness", "Yes, he was my hero and still is I guess. ": "sadness", "I went to a school for massage therapy, but I was worried at first that it would be strange to massage people I didn't know. ": "trust", "Thats cool. Was it hard?": "joy", "Some of it was. I had to learn the name, attachment point, and action of every muscle in the body. There are over 800. ": "sadness", "Wow that is a lot.": "sadness", "I think I get it from my mom. She would never open the door for uninvited guests.": "anger", "What do you get from your mom?": "sadness", "Being bothered by uninvited guests": "anger", "I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!": "anger", "Some people think it's ridiculous to have a problem with that, but I adore my privacy and space.": "anger", "My first dog was a dalmatian. We adopted her and then went right to a soccer game before I even had time to play with her. ": "surprise", "I love dalmatians.": "surprise", "She was a great dog! That game felt so so long though. I had to watch her sitting with my parents while I played. ": "sadness", "How old was she.": "sadness", "6 weeks when we got her. ": "joy", "I have a friend who is always complaining. She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's. ": "anger", "Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.": "sadness", "I didn't know her when she was young, so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable. ": "surprise", "Does she have like some other issues like mentally?": "trust", "I wouldn't be surprised. ": "surprise", "Have you ever put a pair of shoes on your feet that felt so sweet that made your sole happy?": "trust", "I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.": "sadness", "yea, I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!": "sadness", "That is the worse, you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst, happens to me all the time.": "anger", "Yes, I was angry and sad.": "anger", "So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had, or have you been unsuccessful?": "sadness", "nope, I gave up on shoes all together. ": "sadness", "I was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh. I pee'ed my self. I felt like I wanted to die.": "sadness", "Wow, did they notice?": "sadness", "yep, to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder. ": "anger", "They will forget about it soon.": "sadness", "The next day someone had put a diaper in my desk.": "disgusted", "Becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery I became uneasy to shop there.": "fear", "I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?": "sadness", "They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.": "trust", "That's the worst! You think you can trust people, and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again.": "sadness", "I just found out my new insurance is going to cover my big dental surgery coming up. No more bad jibbers!": "trust", "That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?": "joy", "Yes, they are covering $4,500 worth of work. I only have to pay $100 total. I can't wait to have good teeth. ": "joy", "That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.": "joy", "Thanks, I'm a little scared but it will be worth it. Being from the UK bad teeth are in my genes.": "joy", "I have a solo trip coming up. I'm going to Colorado to climb Mt. Elbert Solo. It's the tallest mountain in the united states.": "joy", "I love Colorado, my favorite state.": "joy", "Yes me two. I used to live in Colorado. I have not been up a mountain that big in years, I'm getting the belly butterfly's. ": "joy", "I wish I could live there.": "sadness", "It was a great place to live but very expensive and winter was rough.": "joy", "Last weekend I was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner I got bad gas.": "sadness", "Did you fart?": "sadness", "It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time. ": "joy", "Did they smell?": "disgusted", "Have you ever drove past a cow farm or garage dump? Yes, well those smell better then I did that night. ": "disgusted", "We had a hail storm about a month ago. It ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it. ": "sadness", "Did anyone get hurt?": "sadness", "No, thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area. ": "anger", "Thats good, as long as no one got hurt.": "sadness", "My husband just ran a Marathon. He had no training I was blown away by him. True inspiration! ": "surprise", "No training at all!  Wow, that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?": "joy", "26.2 miles. He walks about 10 miles a day at work so that's some training sorta.": "sadness", "That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?": "surprise", "He wants to do an Iron Man. 126.2 miles, running, biking and swimming.": "sadness", "WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.": "joy", "Yes, I'm well impressed with him. ": "surprise", "I don't like saying this, and this is the first time I have but a few days ago I drove by my ex-wife and mine house, and for a few seconds it made me nostalgic. ": "sadness", "Wow you are brave.": "trust", "Yes, it was only a fleeting moment but it was there. ": "sadness", "I bet you drove fast.": "sadness", "I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little.": "fear", "Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it, I don't think.": "joy", "Yea, until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.": "sadness", "Have you ever done anything else so frightening?": "fear", "Yes, I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it. ": "joy", "I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me, I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!": "fear", "That's i'm so scared but it will be worth it. You only have one life so don't hold back.": "fear", "Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15?": "sadness", "At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.": "sadness", "Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?": "sadness", "Love, it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me. ": "trust", "Well congratulations for taking your time, look at it that way.": "joy", "yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.": "fear", "Maybe try controlled breathing exercises, I'm sure you'll be fine and want to do it again.": "fear", "Hope so. I don't do well with heights.": "fear", "I had a huge exam that like 25 percent of my grade. I study for 2 weeks for it": "joy", "Oh, I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?": "joy", "Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in, so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade": "sadness", "Well, at least you didn't go down in your grade. But, it wasn't right to treat the students like that!": "sadness", "As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress. It makes life easier when you think like this.": "joy", "That is good, how old are you?": "joy", "33 so not super old or super young. Just happy with who I am.": "sadness", "I am 31 so same generation.": "joy", "Have you stopped caring yet? About others opinions? ": "trust", "Got a pizza last night. It gave me food poison. Now I'm stilling here sick and angry.": "sadness", "Oh gosh, I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? ": "sadness", "Yes, I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something. ": "sadness", "Wow! In that instance, I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. ": "sadness", "Yes, for the first 12 hours I just had to lay in the bathroom floor in pain.": "sadness", "I had studied for an exam for several days, so I was confident when I strolled into class because I knew I would ace it": "joy", "and did you knock it out of the park? ": "joy", "Uh, I made a B on it,  so it was a false sense of confidence, lol": "joy", "Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's. ": "joy", "When my son was 5 years old, he had to have his tonsils taken out. I thought it would be nothing, but when they went to take him back, I got so anxious. ": "sadness", "Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.": "fear", "Yeah, he was fine, but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't, but I did. ": "fear", "That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.": "trust", "My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it. ": "anger", "Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?": "disgusted", "We don't know them well, but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after, but some people have to get up for work. ": "sadness", "I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.": "anger", "My dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down. It was a very sad, but necessary decision. ": "sadness", "it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.": "trust", "It was very hard, but she was suffering. Our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon. He assured us that it was not. ": "trust", "She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.": "sadness", "My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit. ": "joy", "Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?": "joy", "About seven months. Too long. ": "joy", "Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?": "sadness", "Yes, about a 17 hour drive. ": "anger", "We had a really great guest speaker at work today.": "surprise", "That's awesome! What did they talk about?": "joy", "He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's.": "surprise", "Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?": "anger", "I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.": "joy", "Sounds like it was very exciting!": "joy", "Yeah he talked about his toughest cases and some funny storties about suspects who incriminated themselves with simple linguistic tricks.": "joy", "I am a bit Breaking Bad fan and love Better Call Saul. Season 4 starts in August. ": "anticipation", "Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.": "joy", "I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting. ": "fear", "I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.": "joy", "I came home today and someone had eaten my leftovers. I was so irritated!": "anger", "I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?": "anger", "Yes, it was my partner. He owes me big time": "anger", "I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!": "joy", "Right! He says i'm greedy anyway, but that's besides the point!": "anger", "I got into some serious financial troubles a few years back.": "trust", "It happens to everyone, are you out of it now?": "sadness", "yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.": "trust", "Oh well, it was nice to have someone to help you.": "trust", "Do you like fair rides? I can't take them myself.": "joy", "I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily": "anger", "Yes, I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.": "sadness", "Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.": "joy", "I just don't think they're safe enough, many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.": "fear", "yeah, and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them": "anger", "I'll just stick to the food and go home. Funnel Cakes and Polish Sausages are my favs.": "sadness", "Two years ago, I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it, i was angry and hurt.": "sadness", "I bet you were, I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.": "sadness", "I know it was a horrible experience at the time, now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up": "joy", "I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.": "sadness", "I wish I could go back to the 80's for a little while at times. ": "sadness", "Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them": "sadness", "That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?": "sadness", "Do you have a favorite era?": "sadness", "Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life": "sadness", "Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think.": "sadness", "Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed": "joy", "I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college. ": "joy", "So if not by studying ,what else?": "sadness", "I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time!": "sadness", "That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? ": "sadness", "No, I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal, but it healed.": "sadness", "You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.": "sadness", "That's hilarious! I can't afford it right now though. I'll just be more careful.": "sadness", "Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core.": "anticipation", "That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!": "sadness", "My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.": "sadness", "Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!": "fear", "I can't believe my husband planned this all by himself! My mind is still blown by this!": "surprise", "Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?": "joy", "We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings, but mostly excited!": "joy", "When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?": "anger", "It's our 10th anniversary. We are making the drive to FL since we live in Georgia. ": "sadness", "Don't you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can't? Well, that happened to me recently. I was going to give away some of my son's old toys, but started looking at then and realized that I need to keep them for no other reason than that I was being sentimental ": "sadness", "That's too funny. You know, I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!": "sadness", "I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol": "sadness", "Yes, someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling": "sadness", "I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago, and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?": "sadness", "Yes, we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town, so it allowed me to get really close with her.": "sadness", "That's sweet, I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!": "trust", "I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday, when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics.": "fear", "Wow, that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?": "sadness", "They couldn't capture him, he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.": "sadness", "That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!": "fear", "I hope not! I'm not good with crisis situations at all!": "fear", "Yes, I was surprise on how he changed to another talk": "surprise", "What was the initial talk?": "sadness", "I should descript how I could feel when am lonely": "sadness", "So how do you feel when lonely?": "sadness", "Wow, the situation is always very bad": "anger", "It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!": "sadness", "Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.": "sadness", "yes, i understood the first time.": "sadness", "Oh, sorry, I meant to say Ex-wife. I am so glad she didn't. The years haven't be kind to her, so got out just at the right time, lol": "trust", "I slipped on a puddle in the mall once. I was so embarrassed that I pretended I was hurt badly.": "sadness", "I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt,": "sadness", "Even animals get embarrassed, I've seen it in my cats.": "sadness", "Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.": "surprise", "Yes, my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.": "sadness", "Oh dang, talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol": "sadness", "One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened": "sadness", "That is a hilarious intro, thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things, you have nothing to worry about ;-))": "sadness", "Well, I most def want to be insightful and intelligent, so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about, but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing \"Along Came Polly\" sceneros in your head. ": "anger", "These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov, you crazy kids!": "sadness", "Lately, my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls,i don't even want to think of i": "sadness", "Is that good or bad? Why the concern?": "fear", "I think it is bad": "sadness", "OK why do you think so?": "sadness", "Boys are meant to be playing with car toys not dolls.": "sadness", "It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can.": "trust", "Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem": "trust", "It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.": "sadness", "I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another, we would not have much problem": "trust", "That is so true! There is no reason for there to be a problem with famine in the world.": "trust", "My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test.": "joy", "Well you should try to study more and see what happens": "sadness", "I did, I can't remember, I either made an A or a B in there.": "joy", "Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf": "sadness", "Well, this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever, but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago, I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me, and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks, in the middle of the road, jumped out, and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short, I saw my own reflection in the mirror. ": "sadness", "THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.": "fear", "It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it, lol": "fear", "That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?": "fear", "I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted, I am 32 now, lol": "anger", "Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared, especially during storms.": "fear", "Why no response?": "sadness", "I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :) ": "anticipation", "Is my response not good enough?": "anger", "You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?": "sadness", "Se": "surprise", "It is really hot here most of the year.": "joy", "Really?  Where do you live at?": "joy", "Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks.": "joy", "I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando, Florida.  So Im in the same boat.": "anger", "Ok I was in Walmart buying a video game when this dud eshows up and immediately questions my selection. Like it's some kind of internet forum!": "anger", "That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???": "anger", "I dunno, but I just said \"That's great, bro\" and left.  Then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it.": "anger", "I would be scared of a guy like that.": "fear", "Well I just got incensed with him and told the clerk to do something about him or I'm not shopping there anymore.  He was told to leave.": "anger", "This was several years back. I was single, but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie, so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong!

": "sadness", "Oh really? What'd ya get?": "joy", "Just stuff for dinner. At the checkout, a guy took my receipt!": "anger", "Why did he do that?": "anger", "I am not sure. He was on his phone though.": "sadness", "I studied really hard for my math test last week, so I knew I would ace it.": "joy", "Math is a tough subject. Good for you.": "joy", "I know, I feel like I can solve math problems that even Einstein couldn't solve.": "joy", "Being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you. Keep at it.": "joy", "We have taken many unplanned trips this summer that I didn't have money for. But I was able to pick up more work and pay for them.": "sadness", "How exciting that you were able to do that. I hope it was fun.": "joy", "It has been a fun summer! I am so tired though.": "sadness", "It's funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation.": "sadness", "Oh yes! I have so many pictures to go through though!": "sadness", "I had a major project and felt very ready to present it to everyone at the office": "joy", "How'd it go": "sadness", "It went well, I think I gained confidence by being so prepared": "joy", "That's great.

How did it go?": "joy", "It was a lot of fun, I had no idea he was planning it": "surprise", "That's amazing, I have only had one brithday party like that in my life.": "joy", "I found some old toys of mine": "sadness", "What kind?": "joy", "Some action figures I had when I was younger, I felt pretty nostalgic": "sadness", "I use to have a G.I Joe.": "joy", "A friend of mine was sick": "trust", "What were they sick from?": "sadness", "Flu, I went over and gave him some food and medicine": "fear", "That was nice of you.": "trust", "A friend who I hadn't seen in awhile showed up at my door": "surprise", "I'll bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them?": "surprise", "I was very happy to see him, we ended up going out for drinks": "joy", "Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch?": "sadness", "I met a girl I hadn't seen in some tme": "fear", "Was she your girlfriend?": "sadness", "No, but we did end up going out on a date": "sadness", "That is great, did you have fun?": "joy", "I really hated it when my dog got into the trash. It spilled everywhere.": "disgusted", "Yeah, thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault.": "anger", "Yeah, it was pretty gross. A lot of rotten food.": "disgusted", "Yeah, that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again?": "disgusted", "I did. He is just a puppy, so hopefully he will grow out of it.": "trust", "I really miss my dog. We had to put her down.": "sadness", "That sucks. What was his name?": "sadness", "Barney. He was such a good boy.": "sadness", "Barney was the name of my hamster.": "sadness", "I was very anxious to start driving at 16.": "fear", "I know that feeling. It's nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.": "fear", "It really is. It's like I can't remember all the rules of the road.": "sadness", "It's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time, that would definitely get me nervous.": "fear", "I cannot wait to see Taylor Swift in concert!": "joy", "My wife, LOVES taylor swift. ": "surprise", "I actually went to high school with her. I cannot believe she is as famous as she is.": "surprise", "That is awesome, I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world.": "joy", "A female coworker came onto me at work the other day, but I refused her advances because I love my wife.": "trust", "I am glad you love her, it must be a nice feeling": "trust", "Yes, I just can't see myself being with another woman.": "sadness", "That is a good thing then": "trust", "I cant believe I got arrested for a DUI this weekend, I let myself down.": "sadness", "That wasn't smart.": "sadness", "I know I promised myself I wasn't going to drink anymore.": "sadness", "Why did you then?": "sadness", "I feel good about my last semester. I think I'll do better in my engineering classes this fall.": "joy", "Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?": "joy", "I'm doing mechanical, it's pretty hard but it's interesting. A career in the field would be awesome!": "joy", "Yeah, I think once you get in the field, you're set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that, you sound like you know what you're doing.": "joy", "Thanks, I hope I can keep it up, good luck to you as well!": "joy", "I hate taking the but, today I was late to my stop and got there just as it drove away....": "anger", "Oh, the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday.": "sadness", "I drove my parents' old car for a little, and i definitely took that for granted until it broke down lol. I'm trying to save up, I hope I get one too.": "sadness", "Well, keep working at it. It's a process. ": "joy", "Absolutely.

I wonder if I did the right thing by not telling my boss.": "anger", "Is there a reason why you didn't tell your boss?": "sadness", "I just didn't want to be labeled as a snitch, but now I'm having second thoughts.": "fear", "Is there a way you could report it anonymously?": "disgusted", "I hate when it rains, especially for several days at a time.": "sadness", "Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.": "joy", "How has the weather been where you are.": "joy", "It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.": "sadness", "Oh no, does that happen a lot when it rains near you?": "sadness", "Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.": "anger", "Hopefully it doesn't rain this week but the forecast is at least 60% all week!": "anticipation", "I remember when we used to compete with Yo-Yo's to see who could do the best tricks.": "joy", "My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called \"Around the world\" and also one called \"The cradle.\" Know those?": "anger", "Yes, my favorite was called \"Walk the dog\".": "sadness", "Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.": "sadness", "Last week we were at an amusement park and I cant believe my little brother got on the roller coaster with us. He's usually afraid of heights.": "fear", "Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high.

": "fear", "does it happen often in your part of the country?": "trust", "Yes especially in the summer time storms are bad and hurricanes are at a high I hide under my covers lol.": "sadness", "wow.  i can only imagine": "sadness", "I was using the toilet at Walmart yesterday and somebody walked in on me.": "sadness", "Thats nuts.": "anger", "Whats worse is that I was in the wrong restroom.

I thought it was going to jump on me.": "fear", "OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. i'm terrified of spiders and bugs": "disgusted", "OMG me too! I hit it with a rolled up news paper and a bunch of baby spiders came out. I had a panic attack and stomped on them.": "fear", "i would have a heart attack!": "fear", "I will never forget the first time I felt old.

I just never knew he was that athletic.": "anger", "it does sound like an amzing feat": "joy", "I got on social media yesterday and saw that my friends went to a party, but they didn't invite me.": "sadness", "ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it": "sadness", "No, sometimes I feel like they just don't understand me.": "sadness", "do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you / put you down 90% of the time?": "anger", "Awhile back I was taking a relative to get a heart cath. The surgeon sent for me to enter the operating room.": "sadness", "Is your relative okay now?": "fear", "oh yes, thank you for asking. other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok.

": "anger", "A friend needed help moving": "sadness", "So did you help him / her": "trust", "Yeah, he didn't know of anyone else to turn to for help so I gave him a hand": "trust", "That's pretty nice of you": "trust", "Yesterday my friend bought the Ferrari I always wanted. I deserve it more than him.": "anger", "Wow, thats a nice car": "surprise", "Yes, I don't know how a clown like him ended up with one before I did.": "fear", "It happens sometimes I guess": "sadness", "I was thinking about my old neighborhood": "sadness", "Memories.. what state? ": "sadness", "Can't say, but I was mostly just thinking about the friends I had there growing up": "sadness", "I understand but memories are always nice. ": "sadness", "I needed to use my car to drive somewhere, but couldn't": "trust", "What happened with your car then?": "anger", "My car was hit while parked": "anger", "Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?": "anger", "I was at a Journey concert with my son and he had to go to the bathroom while they were switching out performers. ": "sadness", "I would love that show": "sadness", "It was a very good show, but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.": "sadness", "Oh well, it happens": "sadness", "i am suffering from severe fever for the past two days i don't have any energy ": "sadness", "Have you been to the doctor?": "fear", "yes i had. he prescribed medicine for curing ": "sadness", "You will be fine then": "sadness", "i will take care of my self. thank you so much for your concern. take care of you too.": "trust", "Sometimes I'm surprised my son is actually my son. He currently has enough merit aid to pay for 2/3 of his college tuition!": "surprise", "Well that is quite the accomplishment. ": "joy", "It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best.": "sadness", "He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.": "joy", "I now have a new boss, and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him.  You never know how you will be received.": "joy", "Oh man, that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?": "fear", "He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations, and I have to say, I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other, so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.": "trust", "Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out, but that may be me speaking too prematurely": "anger", "My mother will be 85 in a few days. My sister planned a surprise party knowing the day, hour and location would be very difficult for me to attend.": "surprise", "I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.": "joy", "It is day after tomorrow and I am still not certain I can work it out. Sometimes people are very inconsiderate.": "anger", "That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.": "sadness", "My cousin just called with the craziest story. She and her family are locked inside a cemetery.": "sadness", "Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?": "fear", "They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around. I guess her husband lost track of time. The worst thing is they haven't eaten anything since about noon.": "anger", "Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?": "anger", "You hope your teens make the right choices, but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong.  He is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much.  I believe this is healthy, but I can help but want something different.": "sadness", "I know it is hard to start letting go, but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry, you are not alone.": "fear", "That's what my own mother says.  In fact, she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said, \"Hey, I'm staying the night at so and so's, be back tomorrow.\"  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!": "sadness", "Yeah, they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.": "sadness", "I witness a great sight. I saw a gas station attendant leave his post to pump gas for a lady who has a hard time getting around.": "surprise", "That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.": "trust", "The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.": "trust", "Ohh, that makes sense. Yeah, then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.": "surprise", "I have been fortunate to live a good life but I found a lump in my neck.  Most people would get it checked out immediately.  I waited.  I was scared to get the news.": "fear", "I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad, I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?": "fear", "I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it, and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news, but still had to have removed.": "fear", "I'm so glad to hear it was good news, though!": "joy", "Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family.": "anger", "Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute, so cherish those you love!": "sadness", "It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.": "sadness", "It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!": "sadness", "I am off work for a month in the summer, but I today was my first day back, and it felt great to be back on a routine!": "joy", "Coming back to work could be good after a break.": "sadness", "A month is a great break to \"get away from the daily grind\" but believe me, at the end of week one you think oh, I have all the time in the world, and you aren't as productive.": "sadness", "I understand": "sadness", "I still can't believe I did that. My power had been off and I didn't even realize it.": "sadness", "That isn't good.": "sadness", "I arrived at church just as everyone was leaving. Boy did I feel awkward": "sadness", "Did anyone help you?": "sadness", "When I was pregnant, I thought so much about what my son would make me feel!": "joy", "I wish I could feel that feeling, (unfortunately, I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?": "trust", "I named him George, men can have feelings of their sons too. Hopefully one day you will as well.": "joy", "I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.": "joy", "Thank you! My husband was excited when I was pregnant, but I don't think he got it until he arrived.": "surprise", "Have you ever been hospitalized? It's not much fun. I had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days.": "sadness", "I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?": "sadness", "I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.": "anticipation", "Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.": "joy", "I have a full time job that doesn't pay anything.": "joy", "That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?": "sadness", "I love my job, it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma.": "joy", "Well, as long as you're doing something you enjoy, that's all that really matters.": "sadness", "It does! I love being there with my family.": "trust", "I have a table that is somewhat unsteady, I put my computer on there because I have no where else to put it. ": "sadness", "Have you figured out what's the problem?": "sadness", "I have not, it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though I tell him repeatedly not to do that!": "anger", "Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? ": "sadness", "It could be, I just hate when he doesn't listen!": "anger", "My 2 year old daughter keeps picking up random words lately.": "sadness", "Yes? thats so cute, but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them": "sadness", "I know!  She said the f word!": "joy", "OMG, well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them, and also when you are not with them!": "sadness", "I went to a concert last weekend and saved the tickets.": "joy", "Are you keeping it as a souvenir?": "surprise", "I am, I plan to scrapbook it once I get the pictures back.": "sadness", "Nice, I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.": "surprise", "We recently went camping.  Everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!": "joy", "I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?": "joy", "We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!": "sadness", "Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants, but there was probably none left!": "sadness", "This Spring has really made me appreciate family.": "trust", "What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?": "surprise", "My grandmother fell ill, and passed away.": "sadness", "Ho, I am sorry to hear that.": "sadness", "I got a notification on my phone that I had a package delivered and went to look for it": "anger", "Too late I already took it. Just kidding, did you find it?": "fear", "I did, they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!": "anger", "Oh, that's bad. Was there anything important in it?": "sadness", "It was some pills for my dog, luckily I found it before it got run over. ": "fear", "My son and wife are coming for a visit. Been a long time since I have seen them": "joy", "Wao thats so cool you must so excited, how long has it been?": "joy", "about a year. I am on the east coast and they moved out west": "joy", "Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son, sorry": "anger", "I went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year. I had to bring lots of supplies!": "joy", "Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?": "joy", "When I have my son with us I do! My husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and I pulled one out of my purse!": "surprise", "Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared. ": "joy", "I have been married for ten years. Since we aren't swingers, I'm a one man kinda lady.": "trust", "That's cool. I am not a swinger either.": "sadness", "Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.": "sadness", "How did you do it?": "joy", "It's a commitment to stay with just one person.": "trust", "After a full year of trying to get a leak fixed, I got help from a neighbor's roofer, who \"knew a guy.\"  He said the guy didn't work on roofs, so I was confused!": "anger", "That makes no sense.": "sadness", "Exactly!  The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there, the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out, this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the \"gutter\" on site, and I have had NO leaks!": "disgusted", "That seems like a good price.": "joy", "its so hot here. i've had to shower like 3-4 times a day cause you start sweating anyway and it feels icky. Hows the temperature at your place?": "joy", "right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold": "joy", "what? where the hell do you live? what do you mean its freezing? oh my god i am so jealous": "anger", "haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home": "anger", "ooooh you have an AC, thats why.

": "sadness", "Oops. I meant I was upset when my dog died.": "sadness", "I'm sorry, How long has it been?": "sadness", "Happened in Febuary.": "joy", "That's always a tragedy.": "sadness", "Yea she was 12 yaers old, and had cataracts, so I knew it would happen someday": "trust", "Last week, my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents. The whole time I was on edge because I wanted to make a good impression.": "joy", "That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?": "fear", "Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions, but I think they liked me.": "surprise", "It probably went well, despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.": "sadness", "We love going on our annual family camping trip, and just got back from it!": "joy", "Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?": "trust", "We went for a week, but did have to come back to town once.": "sadness", "Oh no, What happened?": "sadness", "Nothing bad.

Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?": "sadness", "We went camping, yes.  We're in the Midwest, so no mountains, unfortunately.  But we were near a lake.": "joy", "Lakes are awesome.

How long are you guys staying?": "joy", "We were out there for a week.": "sadness", "I did well on a project for a company": "joy", "Did you get anything extra, like a bonus or a trip.": "joy", "I think I might get promoted based on the work": "joy", "Great. What business is it?": "joy", "I was on my way home when a car drove through a huge puddle near the sidewalk": "surprise", "I can tell where this is going.": "joy", "I got completely drenched, it was terrible": "sadness", "That has never happened to me. Thank god!": "sadness", "I am a stay at home mom. School just started.": "joy", "Well does that make you anxious?": "fear", "It does, this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten.": "sadness", "Oh, that would be rough. I've been through that too.": "sadness", "How did you make it through?": "sadness", "A close friend of mine has to leave the state for work": "sadness", "Are you happy for him?": "joy", "Kind of, it's going to be sad since I won't see him again most likely": "sadness", "But if is a great opportunity for him, you should be happy.": "joy", "A friend was able to fix a problem I was having": "sadness", "That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?": "trust", "Computer problem.  It was something I couldn't figure out on my own": "fear", "Bah, those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.": "sadness", "My coworkers sometimes put more work on me than necessary.": "anger", "Why do you think they do that?": "anger", "They don't want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while.": "anger", "That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.": "anger", "I agree, I'm actually up for a new position so if that happens they'll actually have to do work for a change.": "anticipation", "I moved to tornado alley a few years ago. I'm not used to large tornadoes so I was pretty scared when it started storming.": "fear", "Oh man, I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.": "sadness", "We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced. ": "sadness", "Jeeeze, yea, it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?": "fear", "I love it here, except for the tornadoes and snakes. ": "joy", "It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long, happy, and fulfilling lives!": "joy", "I can't believe I spent 2 hours in the car just to arrive to surf and no waves to be seen. ": "surprise", "That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?": "sadness", "Kiteboard but I left half the gear at home. The surf report said 10 foot waves and it's flat water. Not cool bro, not cool": "anger", "Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?": "sadness", "Go to the surf bar I guess.

One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.": "surprise", "My kids spilled juice on my brand new white carpet. I told them not to brink food, or drinks in the living room. When will they learn?": "anger", "OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?": "anger", "Yes, but I had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed.

It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.": "joy", "that's true. i don't like dealing with people.": "anger", "So this one time I walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself. He just taught himself to do it, I had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool.": "surprise", "lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time": "sadness", "I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.": "anger", "wow , i would love to have a cat like yours ": "trust", "I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things.": "sadness", "Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?": "sadness", "It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.": "surprise", "haha that must have been a crazy concert! ": "anger", "This friend of mine is constantly job hopping, I don't even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily, whereas when I left my last job I could barely get interviews.": "anger", "Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as, say, an administrative job": "anger", "She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.": "sadness", "Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture": "anticipation", "I am ready to start renovating the rest of my house.": "joy", "OOO I love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?": "sadness", "I finished my kitchen, so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really. ": "sadness", "Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!": "sadness", "Oh yes, we haven't decided on the color yet.": "joy", "This morning I woke up and I was in such a good mood that I just started singing in the shower.": "joy", "That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?": "joy", "I don't know, I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.": "sadness", "Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!": "anger", "I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little, how different the world was.": "sadness", "I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff": "sadness", "Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!": "surprise", "Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids": "trust", "For my birthday last year, a coworker gave me cheese. It sounds ridiculous but I was touched by her thoughtfulness. I love cheese!": "trust", "I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?": "joy", "Smoked gouda, one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha": "sadness", "Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?": "joy", "YES. Basically anything meat and cheese and I am totally there!": "joy", "My cat had really bad breath so I took her in to the dentist. It turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled, poor thing was in so much pain.": "trust", "Aww poor baby, hopefully shes doing fine now.": "sadness", "She's doing great, thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.": "trust", "That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.": "trust", "When I was a kid, I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's, just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food.": "sadness", "Ha, I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.": "sadness", "Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.": "sadness", "True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!": "joy", "I'm so nervous. I had a job interview the other day and haven't heard back yet.": "fear", "Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?": "sadness", "They said within the week, I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!": "joy", "I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!": "fear", "Unfortunately, I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.": "sadness", "Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)": "anger", "I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!": "sadness", "I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like \"okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?\" Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.": "sadness", "I went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that I did not order. ": "anger", "Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?": "anger", "It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.": "sadness", "I would have complained.": "anger", "Oh, I did, she immediately said ok I'll take it off like it happened all the time. Made me think it was done on purpose just to see if I  wouldn't notice.": "sadness", "Since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away, I usually spend Thanksgiving alone. It sucks sometimes.": "sadness", "Ohh, I feel sorry for you": "sadness", "Oh don't feel bad, I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.": "sadness", "Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!": "sadness", "I spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment. It sucked at the time but it was so nice when I was done to just chill out and watch TV.": "joy", "Yes, I feel you. Cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!": "joy", "Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.": "joy", "Me too! You seem just like me!": "joy", "My husband and I closed on our first house last week!": "fear", "That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?": "joy", "It is! Lots of blood, sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things, haha. We can't wait to move in!": "anticipation", "That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!": "joy", "my daughter moved to California and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing I could immediately do.": "sadness", "Are there any other family members out there that could help her?": "trust", "No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.": "sadness", "Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out.": "sadness", "They took her to the hospital for evaluation but she ended up just being a bit bruised up. I was worried something like this would happen. Everything did work out in the end though.": "trust", "Recently I was contacted by my former company, begging to get me back. I felt really good about the salary negotiation since I knew they needed me.": "joy", "That's great! I am happy for you!": "joy", "Thanks, I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week, it's pretty amazing.": "joy", "Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!": "trust", "i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !": "surprise", "i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule ": "fear", "yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.": "sadness", "same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will ": "sadness", "yes i think it is going to be a long week or so.": "joy", "My dog died this past December and I've had a really hard time getting over it. She was our family pet.": "sadness", "I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past, so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.": "sadness", "She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently, which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives. ": "surprise", "Aww that's great! What breed? ": "trust", "The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy.": "fear", "Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?": "fear", "Yes, thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!": "fear", "Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long": "fear", "my doggie recently passed away": "sadness", "I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.": "sadness", "no i don't think so, but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.  ": "fear", "Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!": "anger", "i don't think i will ever know. they usually don't stop when that happens.": "sadness", "The other day I woke up and without looking I stepped in warm cat vomit.": "disgusted", "oh man, that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.": "disgusted", "Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey, I should have known better and watched where I was walking.": "disgusted", "how many cats do have?": "trust", "Well right now I have six but they're not all mine, I foster for a cat rescue. Three are mine, three are for adoption. It gets crazy in my house!": "trust", "My dog died last year. ": "sadness", "Aw, I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?": "sadness", "About 5 years. He was a rescue.": "sadness", "They say dogs are mans best friend. ": "trust", "That's true. He was definitely mine.": "sadness", "What kind of dog was he?": "sadness", "He was a pit and lab mix.": "sadness", "Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. ": "sadness", "The worst phone call I ever got in my life was when I was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live.": "sadness", "Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago, I know how terrible that feels.": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.": "sadness", "Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day,": "sadness", "They will live on in our love and memories. I hope the heaviness lessens one day at a time <3": "sadness", "The other day I checked my email and a former client I did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! I was happy.": "surprise", "surprise gifts are always fun.": "surprise", "Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.": "surprise", "that sounds like a well deserved plan.": "joy", "I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters, but just being there changed my mind quickly.": "fear", "Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment": "fear", "Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.": "sadness", "Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away": "fear", "i lost $100 cash somewhere. I have looked everywhere and i can't find it": "sadness", "that sounds prettty bad!": "sadness", "yes, i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.": "sadness", "I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.": "sadness", "i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.": "anger", "Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!": "sadness", "I really hate when people let their kids run wild in public. I do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it.": "anger", "I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. ": "sadness", "The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly. ": "anger", "The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.": "anger", "I wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out.": "sadness", "What store were you at? ": "sadness", "I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today. ": "sadness", "Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? ": "sadness", "It get's worse no rain check but they insist on giving me customer service number to still receive points towards my card.": "anger", "it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared ": "trust", "Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? ": "sadness", "thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!": "surprise", "Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.": "joy", "yes she is honestly the greatest ": "joy", "That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.": "surprise", "I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more?": "sadness", "Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol": "surprise", "Right! It's almost like, you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!": "sadness", "That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.": "anger", "I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout, I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up.": "sadness", "Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.": "anger", "Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.": "anger", "Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.": "anger", "We can only hope.": "sadness", "When I was in high school there was a girl I had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend.": "sadness", "Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?": "sadness", "Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my \"friend\" asked her out.": "sadness", "Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.": "anger", "I had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out.  Some time later I found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one.": "sadness", "Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that": "trust", "Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.": "trust", "That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times": "trust", "It really does.  I think when it comes to friends quality is better than quantity.  I like to have friends that feel like family.": "joy", "I cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her VPK graduation.": "sadness", "That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now": "joy", "Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.": "sadness", "That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!": "joy", "I entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won $1000.": "anticipation", "Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?": "joy", "Oh they are long gone,lol. Bills to pay and all.": "sadness", "Bills do take up a lot, don't they.": "sadness", "They sure do. The raffle did allow me to get ahead of things for a while though.": "anger", "One time I moved into a new apartment, it was this big loft in a converted warehouse. I had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound, I thought the place was haunted!": "fear", "Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?": "fear", "Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.": "fear", "How did you discover exactly what it was?": "anger", "I turned off the TV and my phone and tried to trace the sound to its source. I feel ridiculous about it now in hindsight!": "anger", "I have a fear for roller coaster but I let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night.": "fear", "Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?": "fear", "Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride. ": "fear", "I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!": "fear", "My hands was up and feeling the wind in my face and facing my fears but I kept them closed because I just couldn't look because of the height lol. ": "fear", "I had to put my cat down a few years ago, she was old and in kidney failure.": "sadness", "I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.": "sadness", "She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat, she came to live with me when my mom died.": "sadness", "You went through a lot of losses.": "sadness", "Someone buggy was in the way at Publix and I tripped and fell in the aisle. ": "sadness", "That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall. ": "sadness", "I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly. ": "sadness", "Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay. ": "sadness", "I applied for a job one time where I was one of 4 people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if I got it.": "anticipation", "Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!": "anger", "I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.": "trust", "Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?": "joy", "I remember being younger and waiting on Christmas Day to unwrap presents.  There were a lot of things I wanted that year.": "anticipation", "I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?": "sadness", "Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.": "sadness", "The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?": "sadness", "Yea, they tried to trick me and wrap a box of clothes the same size to make me think I didn't get it.  My favorite game has to be Earthbound.": "sadness", "I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating.": "sadness", "Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?": "sadness", "You're right, the other people probably hardly noticed. And no, thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.": "sadness", "I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!": "trust", "That's solid advice, thank you. And yes, I own a helmet, but admittedly don't wear it as often as I should. I will now!": "sadness", "This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries, canned goods, beer. I was set!": "joy", "How'd the hurricane go?": "joy", "Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest, though glad we were safe.": "sadness", "Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.": "sadness", "I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it.": "fear", "Was he okay?": "sadness", "He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it, he is a very nervous dog.": "fear", "Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.": "fear", "That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.": "sadness", "Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.": "surprise", "I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.": "joy", "I bet he is. Don't worry": "sadness", "I usually food prep for the week it is so much easier.": "joy", "That is a great idea": "sadness", "Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track. ": "joy", "Saving money is important": "joy", "My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year": "joy", "That's amazing! You must be so proud.": "joy", "Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.": "trust", "She's also a hard worker.": "joy", "I like to think so, although it seemed to alwasy be easy for her. ": "trust", "Yesterday my Lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment. I thought that was super nice, there were A LOT of bags.": "trust", "That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.": "surprise", "It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it, I didn't want to hold him up. ": "sadness", "Good to know there is still kind people in the world.": "trust", "I got some pink roses at work last week I was so happy.": "surprise", "That's awesome! Who were they from?": "joy", "My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.": "surprise", "That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.": "sadness", "I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband, our four kids, and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though": "joy", "You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.": "joy", "I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough. ": "joy", "That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!": "joy", "I sent an email I shouldn't have sent. I'd been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when I did.": "sadness", "We all do things we regret when drinking": "sadness", "True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days, worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.": "fear", "Thats usually how it goes": "sadness", "A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here.": "fear", "You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?": "trust", "It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.": "joy", "hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.": "joy", "I'm going back to school I am going to stick to my goal and don't stop until I get my degree.": "joy", "I wish you luck": "joy", "Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.": "joy", "I am sure you will meet them": "sadness", "I spent my birthday last year alone. I expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope.": "sadness", "That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?": "sadness", "Yeah, he acted like it was just a normal day, it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.": "sadness", "I would have been disappointed, too. ": "sadness", "I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer. ": "anger", "Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.": "sadness", "Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next. ": "anger", "Oh right, I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.": "sadness", "I went to a book release party yesterday.": "joy", "Cool. Was it interesting?": "surprise", "Yes. It was a good friend of mine. She got a novel published! She also has four small kids. I'm not sure how she does it all.": "trust", "Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol": "joy", "My best friend is moving across the country next week. ": "sadness", "ARe you happy or sad?": "joy", "Sad. I will miss her terribly ": "sadness", "I bet.

No idea actually, it's for a department store here in Australia so will have to look around": "sadness", "There was an \"incident\" at the gym today.": "fear", "I finished a fabulous workout, then promptly fell UP the stairs on my way to the locker room. In front of everyone. I was mortified.": "sadness", "Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!": "sadness", "After four long, broke months of looking, I finally got offered a job today!": "joy", "That's great. Are you excited?": "joy", "Yes, and incredibly happy. I was getting really worried about the bills. ": "joy", "Is it your dream job?

I hope to go there some day": "joy", "You definitely should!

I should have gone back to pick it up but kept going.": "sadness", "I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother": "sadness", "I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time.": "sadness", "Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks": "anger", "I was waiting for a while for a video game to come out.  When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.": "anticipation", "That has happend to me too.": "sadness", "I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time.": "anticipation", "You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though": "sadness", "That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.": "sadness", "We live and we learn lol": "sadness", "Exactly.  Next time I'm waiting for prices to drop, months after launch.": "anticipation", "The other day I was listening to Spotify and put U2's Achtung Baby on. It reminds me of pre middle school days.": "fear", "I used to love that band": "joy", "Yeah they were great back in the day. I can't comment on their new stuff, I haven't listened to any of it in years.": "sadness", "I have not either": "anger", "So the cable repair guy was supposed to show up between 8:30 and 12:30 on Friday. Guess when he showed up....": "sadness", "Probably at 4 or 5! lol": "sadness", "You got it. 5:00. WHY does this still happen? I wasted the whole day waiting. ": "anger", "No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?": "anger", "I got a random email telling me I had won a gift card": "sadness", "Was it real because I get those every day lol": "sadness", "Haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! It was for $120": "surprise", "I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol": "anger", "We had a near-disaster at our house today.": "sadness", "oh no! what happened?": "sadness", "My older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper. It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately, we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.": "sadness", "ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse": "sadness", "We went to our favorite Italian restaurant for dinner tonight.": "joy", "Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.": "sadness", "It was good! It always is. I had my \"usual\" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed, but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday.": "joy", "That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy": "joy", "I didn't have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location": "surprise", "Hm, that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation, since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened, or what did that mean?": "trust", "Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep": "trust", "Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm, no foul.": "anger", "I recently got an email from my old company hinting that they wanted me back. It was kind of exciting, I really wanted it to work out.": "anticipation", "I bet that was a nice feeling": "joy", "It definitely was. The money is great and I get to set my own hours!": "joy", "That sounds perfect": "joy", "I have a dentist appointment first thing tomorrow morning. ": "fear", "The dentist makes me a bit nervous": "fear", "It makes me VERY nervous. I hate it. I'll probably barely sleep tonight because of it. ": "fear", "Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!": "anger", "I got back from vacation last week and found a huge dent in my car. ": "anger", "That is awful, did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? ": "anger", "No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed. ": "surprise", "You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot, maybe they can track down the car.": "anger", "I went to the fanciest dinner party the other night. It was  eight amazing courses of food!": "surprise", "What kind of food was there?": "joy", "Really intricate things - souffles and such. I was very impressed.": "joy", "It is nice that you enjoyed it.": "surprise", "I saw a mouse run across my kitchen last night. I woke everyone up with my screaming.": "fear", "Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?": "surprise", "Stood on the couch and screamed some more! I do not do rodents. I'm having my son handle it. I think he's putting out traps tonight.": "fear", "Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well": "fear", "My kitty that I had since she was a kitten passed away. She was only four years old.": "sadness", "Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.": "sadness", "It really is. She was the first pet that was really \"mine\". She brought a lot of happiness to my life!": "trust", "It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well, just think of all the good times and be thankful.": "trust", "I had a test the other day and I'm pretty sure I aced it. I studied for like a week!": "joy", "That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests": "joy", "Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college, it was a wakeup call.": "sadness", "Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence": "joy", "So all my friends went on vacation last week :(": "sadness", "Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?": "sadness", "Yeah, we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work. I got to see all the pictures on Facebook though, ha! So envious.": "anger", "I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D": "anger", "Sounds like a plan :)": "joy", "I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!": "joy", "Man I am stuffed.  I found a new pizza joint in town.": "joy", "That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?": "joy", "Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.  This place had a all you can eat buffet.  I ate my fill of pizza!": "joy", "You are lucky.": "trust", "I made sure it was the only thing I ate all day.  I was pretty content.": "joy", "Man I couldn't get any sleep last night.": "sadness", "Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?": "fear", "There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.": "fear", "Hopefully you had a lock on them, you can never be too safe.": "trust", "Well that's the thing.  when I looked out in the morning I didn't see anything.": "sadness", "One year for our anniversary, an iPad showed up at my office. My boyfriend had ordered it and timed it so arrived on our exact anniversary. I didn't expect it at all!": "surprise", "Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.": "surprise", "He's generous yeah but I wouldn't call it \"showering.\" He's just good about knowing what I need!": "joy", "That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!": "anger", "I used to enjoy cold showers in the morining.": "disgusted", "I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?": "disgusted", "It's very cold and refreshing, wakes you up instantly.": "joy", "I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !": "sadness", "My neighbor refuses to clean up after her dog and it's infuriating.": "anger", "wow that is very rude of her": "anger", "It really is. I'm not sure what to do though besides reporting her to the HOA. Any suggestion?": "sadness", "No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me": "anger", "Lucky you! For some reason I seem to be attracted to apartments filled with rude people.": "anger", "What else do we need, just a sunny bench and some chips.": "joy", "I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.": "fear", "So lets go, I'll meet you outside in an hour. ": "anger", "Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!": "joy", "I am looking forward for tomorrow. ": "joy", " I will be expecting to see you there.": "anticipation", "Yes, tomorrow as well as today are such a nice places. ": "joy", "Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.": "joy", "I was walking around town yesterday and saw a girl with crazy hairstyle.": "disgusted", "Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?": "surprise", "It was...Dandelion. ": "sadness", "Is that a reference to the color of the hair, the shape or something else?": "anger", "Man I felt good when I applied for my job!": "joy", "How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!": "fear", "No I was very assured in my interview.  I got the job, probably because of my attitude.": "joy", "Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.": "joy", "I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.": "sadness", "Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly, once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality. ": "sadness", "It can be, but personality can't make up for incomptence either.": "sadness", "I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.": "sadness", "I flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time. I can't believe how much time has passed.": "sadness", "Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!": "sadness", "Enjoy it, your 30s go by really fast. I'm clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself.": "joy", "I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.": "sadness", "It's very strange when you meet somebody you know, in the middle of a megalopolis. ": "sadness", "Yeah, it's like a small world.": "joy", "Exactly, how does it even work?": "joy", "I think it is merely a coincidence.": "joy", "Small thing in life used to make me shed tears.": "sadness", "Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?": "sadness", "Yes, things like great classical music for example. ": "joy", "Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry": "sadness", "We have to stay positive through all the things that happen in the world. ": "trust", "I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. ": "sadness", "Yes, that's a good start.": "joy", "Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important. ": "fear", "Someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise.": "anger", "That's awesome!  What do they do?": "joy", "They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.": "anger", "That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.": "sadness", "Last week driving to work, I got pulled over for speeding.": "trust", "That sucks. How fast were you driving?": "anger", "Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.": "fear", "I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit": "sadness", "I haven't drank beer in almost a year, but yesterday I relapsed. I feel like such a loser.": "sadness", "Oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow": "sadness", "I just can't believe I gave in to the pressure. Oh well, yeah your right. I'll start by taking baby steps.": "joy", "Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans, we make mistakes. ": "sadness", "My neighbor is remodeling his house, which I hate, because they start at 5:30 in the morning.": "anger", "That is probably so annoying": "anger", "I have a 3 year old, so he wakes up at 5:30 because of all the hammering going on.": "joy", "That really sucks. How long will it be going on?": "sadness", "My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby.": "surprise", "Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky, depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?": "sadness", "Yeah, it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.": "surprise", "Well, then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck, and enjoy this time! :)": "joy", "I went to see a movie last night. I wasn't really able to enjoy it though.": "sadness", "Why not?": "sadness", "There was this couple sitting two rows in front of me.... they just wouldn't shut up.": "fear", "Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.": "sadness", "I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. It was alright, but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first.": "fear", "I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? ": "sadness", "I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.": "fear", "right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! ": "sadness", "My mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer.": "sadness", "Is she doing okay now?": "sadness", "Yes, she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving. ": "joy", "great, I am very glad to hear she is getting better!": "trust", "I was very pleased to get this job": "joy", "What is the job?": "joy", "I got the job has an software Analysis and that was aim": "joy", "Well congrats then, I am sure that is not easy": "joy", "A little bit. But when we doing it in a rightway from our heart really it will be easy ": "sadness", "I was so angry, I threw a bottle of water!": "anger", "What caused that to happen?": "sadness", "A server went down and I didn't get paid for my work :(": "sadness", "Oh gosh, hopefully it doesnt happen next time": "sadness", "Yeah I hope not, I can't afford work stoppages!": "anger", "i felt nostalgic looking through old photos today": "sadness", "What were the photos of?": "sadness", "just old family photos": "sadness", "It is good to have those and look at once in awhile": "joy", "A couple months ago, my wife and I got divorced.": "sadness", "I am sorry to hear that, what happened?": "sadness", "We just grew apart I guess. House seems so empty with her and the kids gone.": "sadness", "Did you try therapy at all or counseling?": "sadness", "We can't afford to live in our home anymore": "sadness", "Why is that?": "sadness", "We're poor, and bills are adding up": "sadness", "I am sorry to hear that, I hope things improve for you a ton!": "sadness", "Thank you! I do as well": "joy", "Boy, it's been a lot of owrk": "joy", "Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many": "sadness", "What sort of things?": "joy", "I interpret the difficulties": "joy", "What sort of difficulties/": "joy", "the lack of humor": "anger", "Ah, it's no joke is it": "sadness", "Ok": "sadness", "Last year, my father passed away.": "sadness", "Oh goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?": "sadness", "Yeah, he developed a stage 4 glioma in his brain that could not be removed.": "joy", "That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.": "sadness", "i feel nostalgic going through old boxes in my basement": "sadness", "What kind of stuff is in there?": "joy", "just old sports uniforms and toys and stuff like that": "sadness", "Oh okay, I love going through my old stuff too, it is really fun": "sadness", "I have plans so go to the beach with my wife for a week next month": "joy", "That sounds so fun!": "joy", "I cant wait! we have been looking forward to going back since our honeymoon.": "joy", "I hope you both have tons of fun!": "joy", "Thank you. We plan on it!": "joy", "I'm so glad my health is good": "joy", "that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.": "trust", "We do, and don't do enough to take care of it": "trust", "i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me": "sadness", "Ah, it'll catch up to you :(": "sadness", "Oh man. I can't believe I made that mistake at work today.": "sadness", "Uh OH what happened": "sadness", "I was giving a presentation on the project that I'm working on, and I overlooked something simple.... one of my coworkers called me out on it. How embarrassing.": "sadness", "Oh no, well mistakes do happen, it will be behind you in a few days": "sadness", "I certainly hope so. The sooner everyone forgets about this, the better.": "sadness", "Exactly good luck": "joy", "Thank you, I'm just glad it was at the end of the presentation so I was able to get out of there shortly after.": "joy", "I love to see old stuff from when I was a kid": "sadness", "Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?": "sadness", "Old metal lunch boxes like Charlies Angels speed buggy ect": "sadness", "I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?": "sadness", "Hong Kong Phooey lol": "joy", "Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid.

We get along really well, so I'm sure she's going to say yes.": "joy", "What all is on the agenda for the date?": "joy", "I'm going to take her to this restaurant she really likes, then go to a movie. I'm gonna show her a great time.": "surprise", "I've finally finished writing the book that I've been working on for the last few months.": "joy", "Great. Are you going to get it published?": "joy", "Definitely! I'm pretty happy with this one, can't wait to get it published.": "joy", "What is the book about?": "joy", "To say anything about it at all would be giving too much away!": "sadness", "Boo. What genre?": "joy", "Oh man. I was cleaning out my fridge, and found something unpleasant.": "disgusted", "OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?": "disgusted", "Well I threw it out. It was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container. It had been in there for months, I think.": "disgusted", "You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again": "anger", "You know, that's not a bad idea. Ugh, it was so disgusting.": "disgusted", "My little one got injured": "fear", "Oh no! What happened?": "sadness", "She fell off a kitchen stool": "joy", "Ouch. I hope she's okay.": "sadness", "Whew. I had a lot of housework to get done, but it's finally finished.": "joy", "thats good, its always a good feeling after": "joy", "Yeah, I'm pretty happy.

That is horrible!  Is he OK?": "sadness", "No, unfortunately he didn't make it.": "sadness", "That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.

I'm pretty upset about it.": "sadness", "My son asked to borrow the keys to my car this morning.": "anger", "Did you let him borrow it?": "anger", "Yeah. I know most people would be worried about doing something like that, but... I trust him not to do anything stupid.": "trust", "That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?": "joy", "Yeah, he brought it back in one piece. Which I'm obviously happy about.": "sadness", "Awesome. Alls well that ends well.": "joy", "My daughter asked to borrow my car to go out tonight...": "anger", "Did you say yes?": "sadness", "I haven't given an answer yet.

Trust me, I know.": "joy", "I'm sorry to hear that :( It'd be nice if work paid better": "sadness", "Yeah, definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?": "sadness", "I was sad when I had to put my dog down last month": "sadness", "Oh no, I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life, and they're truly part of the family.": "sadness", "They are very much family. I cannot believe we get so attached.": "trust", "Yes, they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life, so try to take comfort in that.": "sadness", "I was recently promoted at my job. I didn't expect it to happen, but I got it through hard work so I'm pretty excited about it!": "joy", "That is great! Doing what?": "joy", "Thank you!

It's not my favorite thing to do, but the raise is great!": "anticipation", "I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!": "joy", "I recently went on a long road trip. I wasn't too worried, though, because I packed everything I needed to make it as stress-free as possible. '": "joy", "I can never go on long trips.": "sadness", "Why not? They used to bother me, but I'm finding that as I get older, they're not so bad.": "sadness", "I can no longer afford them, long trips cost the most.": "anger", "That's unfortunate. I've come to enjoy taking a train as a frugal alternative to flying or driving. No wear and tear on your car, and you don't have to drive.": "anger", "I kept laughing at myself for falling down": "sadness", "Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?": "sadness", "Not bad but it was funny because I slipped on a banana peel!": "sadness", "How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.": "sadness", "I compete in the Highland games around the country. I just got a new kilt and I look amazing. ": "joy", "I am bad at every game.": "sadness", "It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs, hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.": "joy", "I still could not do that, I am very weak human person.": "fear", "You can do anything you set your mind to.": "joy", "I've been very stressed out at work. I had it in my budget so I hired a new office manager. I'm having issues trusting her.": "trust", "Do what i did, quit the job and live at home with mom.": "joy", "I wish. My mom kicked me out at 14 and I've only seen her a handful of times since over the last 20 years.": "sadness", "I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.": "sadness", "I actually really want to buy a van and live in it but my wife said no.": "sadness", "I just pulled up my student loan bill. I've been out of school 10 years and still owe 75k.": "trust", "That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off, but I know many people still struggle with it": "trust", "It started off at 150k so I've paid a lot but it's still crazy. Make me think I would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college. ": "joy", "Yea...the education costs are atrocious and, honestly, not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so": "joy", "I agree. I feel like I've learned just as much or more from MOCC's since then.": "joy", "My boss is piling on the work but keeping my pay the same. He claims he can't afford to pay me more, but I know that's not true.": "anger", "Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.": "trust", "Yep, it's so frustrating. I'm ready to shake up the system but I feel limited in what I can do, besides quit.": "joy", "What kind of job do you have?": "joy", "I'm so shocked, my pants fell down in public": "surprise", "I'm sorry, did anyone see?": "sadness", "I'm hoping not, but it's possible": "anticipation", "I hope you would wear a belt next time.": "sadness", "LOL Yes, I learned my lesson": "sadness", "My best friend has the best job ever. She is paid to travel the world full time and write Blogs on different locations.": "surprise", "That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.  ": "joy", "Yes, I know. Ever day I drive an hour to the same place that is slowly killing me inside and she is jetting off to explore.": "fear", "I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!": "sadness", "Just finished my budget for the week. Woowa, I'm in trouble it's going to be a rice and beans week.": "joy", "LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.": "sadness", "It's better then the alternative. One good meal then water and ketchup soup the rest of the week.": "joy", "eww LOL": "sadness", "Yea, Rice and beans is so much better then that. ": "joy", "I just had my birthday, and my family and fiance did everything they could to make it special. I don't have much, but I'm thankful to have them at least.": "trust", "Happy Birthday!": "sadness", "Thank you! I hope your birthday, whenever it is, is awesome as well!": "joy", "What all did they do for you?": "joy", "Got a big bouquet of flowers, they took me out to eat (lunch and dinner), and we went to the drive-in to top it off :)": "joy", "I was proud when my dog learned to sit.": "joy", "How long did it take for you to teach you dog that?": "trust", "A few days. He was so happy!": "joy", "I thought I would take longer, like months!": "joy", "This week my work offered to let me work an extra day. I thought great overtime. Nope they plan to send me home every other day to even it out": "surprise", "Oh no. Maybe you can get some things done around the house.": "fear", "Yea like working on my resume and netflix.": "joy", "Lol, That sounds like a plan. Working two jobs is hard.": "joy", "I'm so happy I ate good food": "joy", "Yummy... what did you eat?  I am hungry.": "surprise", "I had chicken, asparagus, and a portobello mushroom": "joy", "That sounds so good.  Like I love that stuff.": "joy", "I\"m so happy that no one in my family is sick": "trust", "I am glad no one in your family is sick.": "trust", "Thank you! I hope no one in yours is either": "sadness", "Thank goodness my family is healthy too.": "joy", " went for a job interview.

I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!": "joy", "Oh I spent it on a few things. I was just surprised someone didn't find it when it was being cleaned.": "surprise", "I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have, lol.

": "anger", "It was a whole bunch of different ones from the 90's. Man, they really reminded me of my childhood.": "sadness", "Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.": "sadness", "I keep getting strange phone calls. It's creeping me out.": "fear", "That would creep me out too what kind of calls?? ": "fear", "The person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until I hang up. I'm not sure what I should do about it.": "sadness", "Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird. ": "fear", "My boyfriend told me he quit drinking, but I just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room.": "sadness", "Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?": "anger", "Absolutely, but it probably won't go well. He needs help but he won't accept it.": "sadness", "Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.": "sadness", "Yay! I'm finally getting a promotion at work!": "joy", "Congratulations, that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!": "joy", "Yeah, a raise will definitely come with it. I've put a lot of work into this, and it finally paid off!": "joy", "Hope you treat yourself to celebrate, you deserve it!": "joy", "So I might be up for a promotion soon at work!": "joy", "That sounds amazing!

It is nice to have a day off every now and then": "joy", "it definitely is": "joy", "I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.": "fear", "Ugh, my cat keeps climbing up the curtains in my room.": "anger", "That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?": "anger", "Yeah, he's tearing them up. I really wish he'd stop.": "sadness", "Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?": "anger", "I'm not sure, but I'm going to try to find something that will do that.": "sadness", "We've decided to adopt another cat from the shelter!": "trust", "That is great!

But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.": "surprise", "That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.": "joy", "I've been working hard and doing a great job for several months, but still no raise.": "joy", "thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return ": "sadness", "Yeah, especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit!": "anger", "Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier! ": "joy", "im nervous about taking a test soon": "fear", "Did you study for it or are you winging it?": "joy", "i feel pretty prepared": "joy", "Don't worry then.  You did you part!!

It had several signatures on it.": "sadness", "There's a creepy guy that comes by at work that won't stop bothering me. He writes crazy letters, and keeps calling on the phone \"just to chat\" with me.": "fear", "I would be reporting that to the police for sure. ": "anger", "I tried. They said they can't do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me, which is insane to me.": "anger", "Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane. ": "anger", "My father was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer.": "sadness", "Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.": "sadness", "Yes it was.

They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)": "sadness", "As a child, I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it.": "sadness", "Aw, well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.": "sadness", "True, but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today, but I never can take those things back.": "sadness", "Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.": "anger", "my husband and i lostour daughter 2years ago and i don't care to celebrate mother's day and he still impressed me with a gift": "surprise", "I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?": "sadness", "he got my favorite flower, an orchid a card and made dinner ": "surprise", "That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.": "trust", "thanks": "sadness", "Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1,000 miles, and I felt like such a fool.": "sadness", "Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. ": "sadness", "Agreed, and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!": "sadness", "Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol ": "sadness", "My cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night. I still can't figure out how he did it.": "sadness", "Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat!

She can't seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for 30 minutes straight.": "anger", "Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?": "sadness", "If you make a comment on anything, say cats, she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).": "sadness", "That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.": "anger", "We had an annoying client the other day, and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).": "anger", "Did it feel good to get it out?": "joy", "It did at first, until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything!

Did you get in trouble for it?": "sadness", "I found some baby kittens in my yard, their mother was dead. I nursed them to health and found homes for them.": "trust", "That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.": "sadness", "They are my favorite, too. I love how independent they are.": "trust", "Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!": "trust", "Finances aren't great right now. I've got a lot of bills that are overdue, but I can't afford to pay them :(": "sadness", "I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.": "anger", "I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks, and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.": "anger", "Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.": "joy", "I was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test": "sadness", "You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!": "surprise", "I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off ": "fear", "Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!": "joy", "A few years back I got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money. It broke me, I really loved that job.": "sadness", "Oh no, I am so sorry. What did you do?": "sadness", "To be honest, I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.": "sadness", "That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?": "sadness", "I did, yeah. And strangely enough, the company hired me back a few years later when they were doing better cashflow-wise. ": "disgusted", "im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night": "joy", "Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?": "surprise", "about a year and a half!": "joy", "I hope you all have some fun.": "joy", "I'm SO ready for fall - it's been incredibly hot all summer, and I need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!": "joy", "Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!": "joy", "Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters, snuggling up with a hot drink, and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!": "joy", "It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!": "joy", "A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.": "disgusted", "Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.": "sadness", "Thanks for the tip, I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!": "sadness", "Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!": "disgusted", "I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have.": "anticipation", "That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.": "joy", "Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages, but it's been stressful ever since.": "anticipation", "It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.": "fear", "My friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that I didn't know about.": "surprise", "oh that was nice of them": "surprise", "Yeah, they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.": "sadness", "haha thats pretty fun": "joy", "I have an adorable hamster that doesn't look like he's doing well. He is on the old side for hamsters, and I'm worried he won't live much longer.": "sadness", "Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?": "sadness", "Thank you, me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him, but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.": "sadness", "Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!": "sadness", "I went back to work for my former company recently. They laid me off a few years ago when things were tough. Coming back was a little scary but I was thrilled!": "joy", "That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!": "surprise", "Yes, that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.": "trust", "I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!": "joy", "im upset that my neighbor's dog is sick": "anger", "That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?": "anger", "no they are at the vet now": "sadness", "Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?": "sadness", "Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day, great dinner, concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan...": "sadness", "Oh no, what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!": "sadness", "Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!": "sadness", "Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!": "sadness", "Very true and thats the way to look at it. I was a bit dispirited but the hotel were great and re-arranged it for us and to be honest I could never have left my baby when she was poorly. The best made plans dont always work out when you have kids, but hey I wouldnt change them for the world.": "sadness", "My neighbor has a brand new Tesla and every time I look at it I get so envious. I know it's stupid, I should be happy for him that he has such a cool car.": "anger", "Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?": "joy", "Well that's the thing, I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit. ": "sadness", "You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.": "sadness", "That is a really good way to put it, I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.": "sadness", "lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!": "sadness", "A Tesla with a bike rack!": "fear", "Exactly!": "joy", "I'm happy my package just arrived": "joy", "oh thats nice": "joy", "im glad it came earlier": "joy", "yea i would be to": "sadness", "I'm feeling nostalgic today": "sadness", "I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier": "joy", "Nostalgia is a weird feeling.": "sadness", "I've got a fun weekend coming up, and I'm really looking forward to it!": "joy", "Nice, what do you have planned?": "joy", "Going to the drive-in, out to eat, and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special, just haven't had fun in awhile!": "joy", "Sound great, I'm happy for you!": "joy", "I recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!": "surprise", "Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!": "joy", "It felt amazing to be recognized for my work, and in a publication I respect to boot! ": "joy", "Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.": "joy", "Well I certainly wasn't expecting it so who knows, maybe one day you will!": "surprise", "I am going to Disney next year. I want to write a list of everything to bring.": "joy", "What are some things you will bring?": "fear", "I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.": "joy", "It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.": "sadness", "Things have been rough for me lately, but thankfully I've got family and a fiance that are helping me through it.": "trust", "What is wrong? Are you okay?": "fear", "I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs, and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/": "trust", "I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.": "sadness", "the rain today is frustrating": "anger", "We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.": "anticipation", "im not a fan of it at all": "sadness", "Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.": "sadness", "The other day I was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign, nearly hitting me. Thank goodness I was paying attention and was able to stop in time.": "anger", "Oh my goodness, I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!": "fear", "I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.": "anger", "Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!": "sadness", "Thank you, I appreciate that!": "trust", "My boyfriend proposed to me, and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise.": "surprise", "Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?": "anticipation", "Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year, but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!": "anticipation", "Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.": "joy", "I just had my birthday and I ate WAY too much. Had a good time, but boy do I feel bad for all of that food. I'm supposed to be eating healthier!": "sadness", "I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.": "sadness", "No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too, and how could I say no to that?": "surprise", "Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.": "joy", "i am pleased with the day im having today": "joy", "Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.": "trust", "me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad": "sadness", "That is true. It puts things in context.": "joy", "Every night before bed, we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life.": "joy", "That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. ": "joy", "It is. And shows that he is listening. ": "surprise", "It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. ": "anger", "Our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby.": "fear", "that is frustrating, especially if the weather isnt ideal ": "anger", "Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.": "anger", "that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!": "sadness", "Thank you! At least I was able to get it replaced.": "sadness", "My friend left my front door open when she was house-sitting for me. My cat snuck out and was killed.": "sadness", "That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?": "anger", "I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.": "sadness", "Are you going to get another cat?": "sadness", "When I'm ready, I think yes.": "joy", "I can't wait for it to be Christmas already. Just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy.": "anticipation", "I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!": "joy", "Exactly! And the food, and friends. All of it is just so lovely.": "joy", "I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!": "joy", "Each day waking up I can't believe how lucky am I just to be alive.": "trust", "That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.": "sadness", "Yes, I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.": "anger", "That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.": "trust", "I went running for the first time in months. I could not believe it. I was able to run a full 8 miles with out taking a break.": "surprise", "8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!": "surprise", "Yes, my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.": "joy", "Have you been a long time runner before that?": "joy", "Not really. A few years ago I got tired of being fat so one day I just went out and started running. Two months ago I stopped due to hurting my back surfing. I got the all clear yesterday and went back out.": "sadness", "Just gave my wife access to my credit card. I'm worried but excited I can trust her. Do you ever have issues trusting people?": "trust", "I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!": "joy", "It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.": "surprise", "Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?": "sadness", "It was fun. Adults only resort, all inclusive, private swimming pool off the room but cost 500 a day.": "joy", "\"I've been at my current job 5 years. I'm at the point I can go into upper management but I'm afraid. Maybe I'm just comfortable now. I don't know. ": "fear", "That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?": "joy", "An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA, I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well. ": "joy", "Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.": "joy", "I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.": "fear", "Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?": "sadness", "I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves, Color me impressed!": "surprise", "Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!": "surprise", "Yes,  I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.": "surprise", "Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!": "anger", "A friend of mine bought a new car": "anger", "awesome! what kind?": "joy", "Tesla, I've had my eye on the model for some time": "anger", "oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat": "surprise", "A friend of mine got a new high paying job": "surprise", "That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?": "joy", "I thought it was amazing he got it, seemed like a tough job to land": "surprise", "That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.": "joy", "A co-worker of mine was late delivering materials for a project": "trust", "Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?": "sadness", "The guy just doesn't seem to care": "anger", "That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.": "sadness", "Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit. ": "fear", "It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.": "fear", "I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.": "sadness", "I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.": "anger", "im scared of this big test tomorrow": "fear", "Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!": "joy", "yes i have, still nervous though": "fear", "Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!": "fear", "My wife and I are on a diet together for the last month. We have been doing great but today on my way home from work I stopped for Ice cream and did not tell her.": "trust", "Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. ": "sadness", "Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow. ": "anger", "It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!": "sadness", "I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing.": "fear", "You only get to do it once?": "joy", "Yes, you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.": "sadness", "Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.": "sadness", "I finally got a raise at my job": "joy", "Congrats!": "joy", "I was pretty happy, it was long overdue": "joy", "Was it more than expected?": "surprise", "The other day I was drinking and sent an email I shouldn't have. I felt so stupid when I woke up and realized what I'd done.": "sadness", "That has happened to me, but with texts though lol": "sadness", "Yeah I've done that, too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.": "sadness", "Did you apologize?": "sadness", "No, when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!": "joy", "LOL": "sadness", "My car has been having issues lately": "anger", "what's wrong with it?": "sadness", "Engine issues I think, not sure if the car will make it": "anger", "can you fix it?": "anger", "Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds.": "joy", "That is great news. Have you also been working out?": "joy", "Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.": "joy", "Has it been easy or hard to do that?": "joy", "Rough. I used to like Iced tea and now only drink black coffee or water. I miss flavor. Plus it's a lot of work cooking everything.": "sadness", "I took some candy a friend left out": "sadness", "did they notice it was missing?": "sadness", "Not yet, I plan on compensating my friend for what I took": "sadness", "well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.": "sadness", "I just realized today I have not been home to where my family is from in a little over 10 years.": "sadness", "Ohh wow! Are you excited?": "joy", "No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.": "sadness", "Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though": "sadness", "The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint.": "fear", "That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?": "fear", "Yeah that's what made it weird, it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.": "sadness", "Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all.": "fear", "I hope that's all it was and not that he had some bad motive.": "disgusted", "A close friend said she was having problems with her knee": "trust", "Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.": "sadness", "Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it": "sadness", "Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!": "anticipation", "A co-worker stole my lunch": "anger", "I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?": "anger", "Not entirely sure, I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs": "anger", "Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone.": "sadness", "A friend of mine revealed a deep dark secret I told her in confidence to everyone. ": "trust", "What did you do?": "joy", "I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.": "sadness", "You definitely can't be too careful these days": "sadness", "You're right. It makes me less likely to trust others in the future.": "sadness", "Every single time I go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something. If I don't go to the bathroom no one comes in all day.": "disgusted", "how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?": "sadness", "Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.": "sadness", "ok": "sadness", "I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet.": "sadness", "Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.": "sadness", "It's funny you say that, I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy, which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.": "trust", "Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.": "sadness", "Here's hoping your cat grows on you, they have a funny ability to do so.": "anticipation", "I got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that's higher than I usually charge.": "fear", "Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!": "joy", "Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.": "joy", "Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. ": "joy", "That always makes it worth it to be honest!": "sadness", "Someone hit my car and fled the scene": "anger", "What! First of all, are you alright?": "joy", "Yeah, I'm fine, the car was parked": "anger", "Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though.": "sadness", "'m promoting two staff members on Sunday. They work hard and are great people.": "trust", "That's great. Do they know?": "joy", "They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me. ": "anger", "Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either": "surprise", "'m running my first Marathon Sunday. I'm scared that maybe I did not train hard enough.": "fear", "I have never run a marathon": "joy", "No better time to try then now.": "sadness", "You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one": "sadness", "I will not run If I can't finish. I'm stubborn I'll finish or kill over.": "sadness", "Well that's some sort of motivation lol": "joy", "Just finished my Master's degree now time to take on a PhD": "sadness", "Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?": "joy", "Astrophysics": "sadness", "Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?": "joy", "I have another 3-4 years then I'll go into teaching.": "joy", "I start my last year of my Masters program Friday. I'm scared I feel like I'm all ready behind.": "joy", "Have you tried to talk to your teacher?": "sadness", "No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known, it's one of the hardest schools to get into.": "sadness", "What school is this you are talking about?": "sadness", "Cornell University, after this year I transfer to Princeton for my PhD": "anticipation", "I spent all summer getting ready to write my thesis. I can't wait to get time to start.": "joy", "That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.": "joy", "I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor. ": "anticipation", "Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40,000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!": "joy", "I've been paying on mine and have 75 still to pay. Then I want a PhD so that will be another 50k": "anticipation", "I love to be snuggled up with attention and time with my boyfriend when he doesn't I get sad and jealous. ": "anger", "I can understand that.": "sadness", "I know he has to spend time with others but I get envious I want every minute spent together I'm spoiled lol.": "anger", "You must love him very much, that's good.": "joy", "I do best feeling ever.": "joy", "I'm at a new school and I won't have any friends": "sadness", "Aw, it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time": "sadness", "Yes, but how do I even talk to people I don't know?": "sadness", "The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!": "sadness", "I felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries": "trust", "that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore": "trust", "Yeah thats true most people don't.  I love helping those in need it's a great feeling": "trust", "same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you": "sadness", "I can't believe I didn't get that promotion at work :(": "sadness", "Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.": "sadness", "Agreed, it's a popularity contest!": "joy", "Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough.": "anticipation", "My wife cheated on me! It's absurd!!": "anger", "Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you ": "sadness", "Thank you, what should I do about it?": "joy", "I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds": "sadness", "I was very happy last week helping an elderly women bag her groceries ": "trust", "Did she say thank you?": "trust", "Yes she did thank me ": "trust", "What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!": "joy", "Ugh, my neighbor's dogs wouldn't stop barking this morning!": "anger", "That's the worst! What did you do?": "anger", "Well I'll tell you what I didn't do. I didn't go back to sleep, due to the noise. I think I'm going to have a word with him later.": "sadness", "That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!": "disgusted", "Remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? I miss it.": "sadness", "Yeah, those were better times. Brings back good memories.": "sadness", "Maybe we can relive such times through our children.": "sadness", "Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.": "sadness", "I don't understand why people come to work to just not do their jobs I have a coworker like this.": "anger", "Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?": "anger", "We are on the same page I have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it's like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work. ": "anger", "I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.": "disgusted", "The desert was incredible! The taste! The look!

First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.": "sadness", "My mother died, I'm a mess.": "sadness", "oh dang thats so horrible": "sadness", "Thank you :(": "sadness", "it gets better with time but it must be hard": "sadness", "I really miss Hastings.  I spent so much time in that store when I first started college.  Both just hanging out and working.": "sadness", "I remember that store! I loved going shopping there, was it your first job?": "joy", "It wasn't my first but it was my most favorite retail job I had": "anger", "Yeah, I bet, it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.": "sadness", "It really was.  It was so  laid back and chill.  I also made a ton of great friends there.": "joy", "I pray I can do well in school": "anticipation", "Are you having any specific problem areas?": "sadness", "Not yet, but I haven't started yhet": "fear", "Okay.

But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!": "anticipation", "Do you have a large family, or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?": "sadness", "We don't have a huge family, just 5.  But my wife does daycare, and our current vehicle only has 5 seats, so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.": "anticipation", "5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.": "anger", "Thanks!  If not, we'll still manage just fine.  It would be nice, though.": "sadness", "I'm scared to go to the cottage": "fear", "It is a big change. What is scaring you?": "fear", "I don't like bugs!": "fear", "I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in": "anger", "I am sad my cousin is moving away.": "sadness", "Is it really far?": "joy", "Yes, another country": "sadness", "oh no. im sorry to hear that": "sadness", "I had some friends over and went upstairs to my room.  All the lights were off and when I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.": "fear", "Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?": "fear", "Hahahaha, that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies I had seen!  I let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free.": "fear", "Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!": "fear", "I was totally ready for my garage sale": "joy", "You were ready? That's good to hear.": "joy", "Yes and we made $1026.25!": "joy", "Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif": "sadness", "I have an interview coming up.  Its for a position that someone else already has but I need to do this interview to get my name out there and let the higher ups know I want to move into management.": "fear", "Are you prepared?": "joy", "I am prepared for it.  I'll be a lot happier once it is over.": "joy", "I bet. Good luck to you": "joy", "I went to work the other day, and I was the only person in the office.": "sadness", "Where you supposed to be there? If so, then that is a nice feeling.": "sadness", "Yeah, everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while, but got a bit lonely.": "sadness", "Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. ": "sadness", "It did toward the end of the day for sure!": "joy", "I am starting back at school next month. I am excited about getting back into my classes.": "joy", "That's great. What classes are you taking?": "joy", "I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors.": "joy", "That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?": "joy", "I want to be a software developer I think, so I like the programming.": "joy", "You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.": "joy", "I really like school, so you never know what I might decide to go for next. Thank you for the advice.": "sadness", "Any time. Have a good weekend :D": "joy", "My dog just died in my arms.": "sadness", "Did that happen tonight?": "sadness", "No, it was a few years ago.": "sadness", "Well, it must've been something you said.": "sadness", "My step-daughter just turned 16 in the past week.": "sadness", "Did she have a party?": "surprise", "We're actually having it this coming weekend.": "joy", "Does she have her license yet?": "joy", "No . . . that's a long story involving her idiot father.  I'm somewhat glad, though, as she can't seem to set her phone down.": "sadness", "Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??": "trust", "Text, video chat, watch some goofball put makeup on, and shop.  Things most teenagers do, I suppose.": "sadness", "Does she play any sports?": "surprise", "I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside.": "sadness", "That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.": "anger", "I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)": "sadness", "It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!": "sadness", "I was shocked by my present.": "surprise", "You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?": "joy", "It was my anniversary.": "sadness", "Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?": "sadness", "Humanity is the worst.": "sadness", "I agree..

He also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time.  It was miserable living there.": "disgusted", "So, I take you left to live someplace else?": "sadness", "Haha yes, I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.": "sadness", "Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!": "anger", "I recently tried to get a manager's job in my company, two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job.": "joy", "Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?": "joy", "I had much more experience than both of them, but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.": "sadness", "I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.": "fear", "My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but he made it through college": "joy", "That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.": "joy", "I was.

He had to work hard but made it through it.": "joy", "I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?": "trust", "He did!

It will be great finally living together.": "joy", "Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?": "joy", "We have been dating almost a year.  I'm just excited to take this next step in the relationship.": "anticipation", "It's a huge step, congratulations! ": "joy", "My girlfriends aunt just died.  She wasnt close to her but is still devastated because of the impact it had on her sister.  I'm doing whatever I can to help them both.": "sadness", "Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.": "sadness", "Thats very true.  I know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now.": "sadness", "Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.": "sadness", "My friend and coworker hasnt been coming into work.  People are starting to talk but its hard to stick up for him when he only comes in once or twice a week.": "sadness", "Is he sick or just being lazy?": "sadness", "A little bit of both.  He has bad anxiety but he also has told me he just doesnt like going into work.": "sadness", "I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.": "trust", "One time during Kindergarten, I peed myself because the teacher did not let me go to the restroom": "sadness", "Oh, well that's awful on a little person!

So am I!": "joy", "One of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up. ": "sadness", "Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?": "fear", "Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!": "joy", "That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes.": "surprise", "I agree!. I was so proud of her and her test results surprised me! ": "joy", "The first time my girlfriend slept over I farted on her leg in the middle of the night.  She knew it happened but didnt say anything.  She also doesnt know that I know.": "sadness", "Thats... uh... strange?": "sadness", "It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!": "sadness", "I think so, you're two peas in a pod.": "disgusted", "I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!": "sadness", "Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.": "sadness", "Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.": "sadness", "A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done.": "joy", "One time when I was letting my cat outside, it ran out into the streets and got ran over": "fear", "Oh my god! That's terrible!": "anger", "Then I woke up, it was all a dream.": "joy", "Oh that's so great!": "joy", "my son just won first place at his championship swim meet!": "joy", "That's amazing!

It's alright though!": "sadness", "I'm glad that it all worked out!": "joy", "I have a goal I want to get on here tonight but my dog really wants to play.  I feel bad that I'm not playing with him but would really like to hit my goal before I do.": "sadness", "Oh, I bet you are really torn.": "sadness", "I am, I would think I'll be done pretty soon and then take him for a nice long walk.": "joy", "I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.": "joy", "My girlfriend broke up with me recently": "sadness", "That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??": "fear", "We drifted apart it seems": "sadness", "That is hard!

": "sadness", "He doesnt deserve you,so wipe your tears": "sadness", "I found myself suddenly by myself and it seemed as if all the people I had become friends with were no longer wanting to still be friends.  I mostly met all of them through him when we got together, and when he left me he told them not to speak to me anymore and they listened.": "sadness", "That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too": "sadness", "I dont think they do.  He was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me .

Scares me.": "surprise", "you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance": "trust", "Yes, I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired.": "anger", "i hope it won't happen! ": "fear", "In high school, I fell down the stairs in front of my crush. My face turned red and I ran away!": "sadness", "Oh no! Did he say anything about it?": "anger", "He laughed at me. Looking back, I'm sure it was funny but in the moment, I could have died!": "sadness", "I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly, don't you!": "sadness", "Last night I won a gift card at Trivia night at the pub. Going shopping today.": "joy", "Awesome! What are you planning on buying?": "joy", "I've got a baby due in December so something for the baby or my wife. I never bother getting my self anything.": "joy", "Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!": "sadness", "I found out my wife was dating someone else a year before we got married, we were together for 7 years at that point. Today I'm stressed!": "sadness", "Oh no that is crazy!": "anger", "Yea, We have a baby due in December so I'm trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly.": "fear", "Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out. ": "fear", "Thanks, everything happens for a reason. ": "sadness", "I woke up one morning to make a sandwich. The smell of the sandwich meat made me sick! I felt something was wrong and drove to the nearest store. I purchased a pregnancy test.": "disgusted", "I hate those things, i try to not eat those at all.": "disgusted", "I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!": "sadness", "I eat steak and shrimp.": "disgusted", "I have a friend that will not stop talking about himself. He always wants to talk about his latest investments, the books he has read, and how much he knows about the places that he visits!": "surprise", "i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.": "anger", "I do too. It makes me not want to be around those types of people.": "anger", "i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?": "sadness", "Exactly! I should really stop hanging out with him.": "sadness", "agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.": "sadness", "I am a big Taylor Swift friend! ": "joy", "I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!": "surprise", "Yes I need to arrive at her concert tonight at  8!": "anticipation", "How exciting for you!

I didn't know that place was still in business. ": "joy", "I love to coupon but sometimes I feel like the cashiers aren't trained properly. They will look at the coupon for every detail and do not understand the language in the fine print.": "joy", "Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.": "anger", "I agree. It's not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!": "fear", "I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it": "sadness", "The cop said he was too old!": "sadness", "Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.": "sadness", "Too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving! ": "anger", "That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.": "surprise", "That's what I thought! ": "fear", "I played a game of poker with a friend who had no idea what he was doing. I won about $100 from him that night.": "joy", "Oh no, he shouldn't have gambled. ": "sadness", "You are probably right! I felt bad when I was spending the money. I hope he didn't really need it.": "sadness", "I would've too, but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.": "sadness", "This is very true!": "joy", "Recently there have been a few break ins.": "joy", "Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?": "anger", "No, my neighbor did but that's close enough for me! ": "anger", "For real! Are you taking any precautions?": "joy", "One time I saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food": "fear", "Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?": "surprise", "It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant": "disgusted", "Okay, that makes more sense then to me.": "sadness", "We made sure to board up for the hurricane coming.": "joy", "Where are you located ?": "joy", "We are in Miami, Florida 1 mile from the beach. .": "joy", "I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.": "joy", "The cop said I will probably never find out who did it. ": "sadness", "Who did what?": "joy", "I wont find out who the person was that hit my car while I was sleeping.": "anger", "Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!": "anger", "My sons teacher isn't very nice to the young kindergartners. ": "anger", "Oh no! Why not?!": "sadness", "Not, sure, but she is not very nice at all.": "sadness", "I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!": "anger", "I may never know who she was.": "sadness", "Never know who was?": "anger", "The women that hit my car and left before the police came.": "anger", "Wow that is aweful! ": "surprise", "I agree. And the cop said I will probably have to pay for my own damage! ": "trust", "Near my house, there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted. When I was a teenager, a group of friends and I decided to go check it out.": "fear", "Oh wow, what happened?": "sadness", "When we pulled up, it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!": "anger", "That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?": "fear", "There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!": "fear", "I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!": "fear", "My hair has always been long and I had been scared to have a short hair cut. Last December, I finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair.": "joy", "Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.": "joy", "That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out!": "joy", "Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!": "joy", "I recently drove back to my hometown and went to the towns fair, it felt so nice reliving my childhood.": "sadness", "That's awesome, I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month, it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?": "joy", "It was great, it didn't change much but it still has that 'soul' to it. Just felt great looking at it honestly.": "joy", "Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair, was always fun.": "sadness", "When I was in high school, I dated a guy for almost a year. A few weeks before summer, he broke up with me and started seeing another girl.": "surprise", "You must have been sad and angry.": "sadness", "I was. I would get really mad when I saw them at lunch or after school together. I was my first experience with heart break.": "sadness", "Yes first heart brake is so hard, I feel for you, something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.": "sadness", "This was my first time winning a contest on the raido!": "joy", "That's awesome! Congratulations!": "joy", "Thanks! I will get to go free to the Taylor Swift concert tonight! ": "joy", "No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun": "joy", "I bought extra items during school lunch in high school. I have a negative balance on my account.": "anger", "Ouch, hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.": "sadness", "I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.": "sadness", "I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha, its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.": "sadness", "I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.": "anger", "Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.": "anger", "Yeah we tried but he cut all communication, he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness. ": "anger", "I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! ": "anger", "So i recently traveled to Cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until 3 AM, and as we were walking back there were these 3 guys hiding in the shadows. We got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn't follow.": "fear", "Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.": "fear", "Yeah it was quite an experience, my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people. But they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!": "anger", "Well, at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.": "anger", "Its great, very beautiful and amazing culture (and food!). Just don't drive if you go, they seriously drive like maniacs haha": "joy", "I raised 6 chickens since they were babies. I was trying to let them free range but I forgot to put them back in their coop for the night. A predator was able to get to them.": "fear", "Oh no! That's sad, did he get them all?": "sadness", "Yes, it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.": "surprise", "Aw, that's too bad, hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!": "sadness", "I was looking through old clothes that i was giving away and found $40 in one of the back pockets. Made me very happy lol": "sadness", "wow, so what are you going to do with it?": "joy", "Oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have, trying to get to $220 to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october. Hope i get a pair!": "joy", "nice, i hope that works out for you... good luck": "joy", "I was watching youtube and saw this guy eat a jellyfish straight out of the ocean. Looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat.": "disgusted", "That is gross, I can't even imagine what that would taste like!": "disgusted", "He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.": "disgusted", "That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.": "disgusted", "One of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it, it was like 10+ feet of distance, really amazing stuff.": "surprise", "Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt. ": "fear", "Yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares. It was quite the experience.": "fear", "Did yall happen to get it on video? ": "fear", "No sadly, nobody had their phones with them at the moment. But theres plenty of videos on youtube showing what happens if you dont make it!": "sadness", "My older brother is getting married Friday.": "joy", "Congrats!, I'm sure you must be very happy!": "joy", "I am very happy for him! I thought it was never going to happen!": "surprise", "Haha brotherly love, I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!": "trust", "Having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person's life. I cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born.": "joy", "thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day": "joy", "It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.": "trust", "i bet so!": "joy", "im nervous for the new week to begin": "fear", "Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?": "fear", "very busy and lots of traveling": "joy", "That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away! ": "joy", "I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha": "anger", "We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!": "joy", "Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!": "fear", "Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.": "anger", "I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight.": "sadness", "Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?": "sadness", "I was tired and wanted to get in bed early,": "anger", "Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.": "fear", "Had my finals last week, studied really hard for them. Felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm": "joy", "Great, when will you know your scores?": "joy", "Thankfully i knew them right at the spot, i got a 98!": "surprise", "Wow, that's fantastic.": "surprise", "He doesn;t seem to see the issue.": "anger", "Who doesn't?": "sadness", "My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem. ": "anger", "What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!": "anger", "I studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a 68 on it.": "sadness", "That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?": "sadness", "Yeah, passed with a 75, not what i wanted but at least i passed": "fear", "Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.": "sadness", "i dropped my groceries in the parking lot": "anger", "Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).": "sadness", "i grabbed the cans that rolled away, lol": "sadness", "Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!": "anger", "One of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates 100$ each": "anger", "That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.": "anger", "Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy, worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.": "anger", "Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?": "anger", "A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had \"call ahead seating\" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later, our table was not ready!": "joy", "That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.": "anger", "That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.": "anger", "Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.": "anger", "The food made it worth the wait, for sure! Any other restaurant I would have walked out!": "joy", "We had a new puppy. He loved to chew on everything. I went to the grocery store and when I got back home, the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch. He had chewed through the bottom!!": "trust", "Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.": "sadness", "They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.": "anger", "Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.": "sadness", "I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally.": "sadness", "That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.": "joy", "Same here, they're so incredibly important in this day and age.": "sadness", "It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.": "trust", "i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door": "anger", "Do they run them all day long - or at night?": "anger", "during the morning and day on the weekends!": "joy", "Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.": "anger", "My best friends invited me to a camping trip but I was a little anxious about the whole thing.": "fear", "I don't blame  you because I hate camping.": "sadness", "Really? I was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick. I ended up enjoying the trip in the end!": "fear", "Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.": "anger", "i was blown away by how great my friends were this weekend": "surprise", "What happened?": "sadness", "they were very supportive and kind , helping me with some moving things": "trust", "You are lucky to have such great friends!": "trust", "A few weeks ago I was drinking with some friends at a park and I sliced my hand open while trying to rip a beer can in two.": "sadness", "oh that sucks, i hope it has healed since then": "sadness", "It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.": "fear", "ouch, that sounds awful": "disgusted", "Moral of the story: don't rip open cans with your hands!": "sadness", "i was shocked how nice the weather was this morning": "surprise", "How come? Have you had awful weather lately?": "sadness", "not really but it was just especially nice this morning": "anger", "Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!": "joy", "I decided to move to be with my boyfriend.": "trust", "Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!": "joy", "I did, but I had to leave all my family behind": "sadness", "Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all": "sadness", "im mad at my neighbor today": "anger", "Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?": "anger", "he was using powertools loud in the morning": "surprise", "How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.": "anger", "Last Christmas, I saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts.": "joy", "thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them": "surprise", "Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.": "joy", "me too!": "sadness", "The teacher I had for Calculus 2 last semester was so terrible at his job, I had to learn it all on my own.": "sadness", "I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.": "anger", "Same here. Surprisingly, I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!": "joy", "Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.": "joy", "i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm": "joy", "That's always a great start to a day.": "joy", "absolutely, i was overjoyed": "joy", "How are you celebrating it?": "joy", "I have a big exam coming up tomorrow.": "joy", "Oh wow. What's the exam on?": "joy", "It's on PC Architecture. I'm feeling pretty good about it though. I studied really hard all week.": "joy", "That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.": "joy", "On my way back from a funeral, my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.": "sadness", "I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere, he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.": "anger", "Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.": "sadness", "Agreed. I was so scared we could have been the ones in a casket that night.": "fear", "I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.": "joy", "Congratulations! Retail really does suck.": "joy", "Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.": "anger", "Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.": "anger", "Do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?": "sadness", "Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?": "sadness", "I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.": "sadness", "I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.": "sadness", "A while back, my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.": "anger", "That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?": "sadness", "No idea. All I know is that I was furious, especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.": "anger", "I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.": "anger", "Last night was quite a bummer.": "sadness", "I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?": "sadness", "I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.": "sadness", "That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.": "sadness", "After working for a week straight and running a lot of errands, today is my first day off in a while.": "joy", "That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?": "joy", "It is, I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch, it couldn't get any better than this!": "joy", "Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.": "joy", "I highly recommend it. I can't put it down.": "fear", "My older brother always makes promises he can't keep.": "anger", "That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.": "sadness", "I don't know why. Recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together, but he keeps postponing it. I'll ask him for a definitive day.": "anger", "I hope he doesn't let you down.": "sadness", "I'm so happy for my brother!": "joy", "Something good happen to him recently?": "sadness", "He just graduated from college. He put in so much work.": "joy", "That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.": "joy", "My little brother failed his French class and had to spend three weeks in summer school.": "sadness", "Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!": "sadness", "French is a really hard language, I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.": "sadness", "Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.": "joy", "My boyfriend's brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle.": "anger", "That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?": "sadness", "Some things got broke and there were some bruises, but it was really scary to watch that.": "fear", "I bet. I would've hid under the table.": "fear", "i am blessed to have a great family": "trust", "That's nice. Why do you say that?": "joy", "they're just the best and always very helpful": "trust", "That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.": "trust", "Whenever my sister in law plans things, she only does it around her schedule.": "anger", "That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?": "anger", "Yeah, but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However, we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.": "anger", "Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.": "sadness", "This weekend was kind of a drag.": "sadness", "Oh yeah? Why is that?": "sadness", "I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.": "sadness", "Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?": "sadness", "I was feeling quite social, though, so it was kind of a buzzkill.": "sadness", "The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately.": "sadness", "Are the good memories at least?": "sadness", "Oh yeah, but it really makes me miss those times.": "sadness", "At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!": "sadness", "I'm looking forward to this new game.": "anticipation", "Which one?": "joy", "The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine. ": "sadness", "I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?": "anticipation", "It comes out next month!": "joy", "I told my sister in law that I would help her with her books. After this last one, I felt bad because I told her I couldn't anymore.": "sadness", "That's rough. Why can't you help her?": "sadness", "I just have too much going on now with two kids, and working from home.": "sadness", "Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.": "joy", "I saw some person eat like 30 hamburgers in Mcdonalds": "disgusted", "How long did it take them?": "joy", "I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast, so like 10 minutes": "surprise", "He must of been sick after.": "trust", "One time I bought emergency supplies before a hurricane": "joy", "That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time": "sadness", "Yup, people started charging like $5 per bottle of water": "surprise", "Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal": "disgusted", "I just got some frustrating news the other day.": "sadness", "What was the news?": "surprise", "My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.": "trust", "Are you going to ground him?": "anger", "Definitely at least going to have a long talk about why what he did was wrong. There will be some kind of punishment that's for sure.": "disgusted", "My sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere.": "trust", "Why don't you join them?": "sadness", "We definitely don't have money for that, plus there are four of us.": "sadness", "Why don't you get another job?": "sadness", "Ugh. I got some awful news the other day.": "anger", "That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?": "sadness", "I got news that my grandfather passed away. He was old but no one saw it coming.

He got a lot of cool toys, and ate a bunch of ice cream.": "sadness", "Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it": "sadness", "As he opened gifts, he told people thank you, and told them thanks for coming when they left.  I was pretty proud of our 4 year-old.": "surprise", "Next month my wife and I will take our first vacation since we got married.": "trust", "that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation, where do you have planned to go?": "joy", "We are going to Hawaii for a whole week.

You haven't seen your mom in a long time?": "sadness", "Why! what is the reason": "sadness", "I'm sorry, but I can't understand what you're saying.": "sadness", "Are you were near to your mom": "sadness", "Last year, during the spring, extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded.": "joy", "Oh man!

Last night, I caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at 12am.": "sadness", "Oh man, sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first, but getting to bed early will help with her future.": "sadness", "I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.": "anger", "Well yea, they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.": "sadness", "A group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won $100,000 on the pick 6 last week.": "surprise", "that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket": "surprise", "They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them, and I said no.

I had a bad experience last year.": "fear", "that is horrible, natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them": "sadness", "No, all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters? ": "fear", "not really, the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm": "fear", "When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life.": "joy", "I bet that was a wonderful day": "joy", "It really was, my life finally felt complete.": "joy", "I am very happy for you": "joy", "I got passed over for a promotion at work last week, even thought I had more experience than the other applicants.": "joy", "that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?": "anger", "I did, and it looks like I may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction.": "anticipation", "well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry": "fear", "I remember when I started my first office job out of college. I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect.": "fear", "It's a whole new world when that happens, I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?": "sadness", "I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, but I soon got used to it.": "sadness", "It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.": "trust", "I agree. And if it doesn't work out, you can always move on to something different.": "sadness", "I found some mold growing out in the garage": "disgusted", "Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?": "sadness", "I ended up cleaning it myself, I think I got most of it out": "sadness", "May be worth letting your insruance comapny know.

I've never been so excited in my life.  ": "anticipation", "what is that?": "joy", "It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha": "sadness", "oh that explains it!": "anger", "Yes!

Did you take any pictures?": "joy", "No. my camera isn't good enough to get good pictures, they are so small.": "sadness", "Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!": "sadness", "I was trying to buy a piece of property that came up on the market, but someone put in a bid before I got a chance and it has already sold.": "anger", "The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.": "anticipation", "It is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and I pretty much grew up on, I would have really liked to have owned it.": "sadness", "That would have been awesome if you got it.": "sadness", "I worked for weeks on a presentation for work. I practiced over and over. I felt relaxed the morning of.": "joy", "That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.": "joy", "You are right! I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!": "joy", "Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.": "fear", "I was under the impression that my friends would pay me back.": "trust", "What did they do to you?": "sadness", "They owed me money but never paid me back. I suppose it's not a huge deal though.": "anger", "It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.": "anger", "I worked with daughter for months with learning her multiplication tables. We've practiced and practiced and she still doesn't know them all!": "joy", "I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too.

It made me feel like a bad dog mom! ": "sadness", "Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.": "sadness", "I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better. ": "sadness", "Absence makes the heart grow fonder.": "sadness", "I'm happy with the person that I grew up to be.": "joy", "What are some of your best traits?": "trust", "I'm healthy!": "joy", "Do you exercise often?": "joy", "So we finally found the perfect Rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week!": "joy", "Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha, and even if you did, dogs are worth it.": "joy", "No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy": "surprise", "Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way, I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.": "sadness", "Thank you!  We are so excited!": "joy", "I love going to Disney World. It makes me remember all the wonderful memories I made there as a child.": "sadness", "I've never been, but it looks like so much fun.": "joy", "It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet, but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday. ": "trust", "It would be so much fun to go there as a family.": "sadness", "Sometimes when I am out in public, my son throws a tantrum.": "sadness", "Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2": "sadness", "Mine is 5.

But there was mold.": "disgusted", "ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it": "disgusted", "The head of marketing at my job recently dumped a bunch of new tasks on me and my coworker. I feel like she's just lazy and making us do her job.": "anger", "or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks": "joy", "Ha, that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.": "joy", "did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel": "sadness", "I thought about it but no, it's not worth rocking the boat. If she tries to pull that again and dump even more on us, then I'll probably say something.": "anger", "I can't believe this!  Some kid at the gas station nearly hit me and then had the nerve to call me awful names!": "fear", "Did you call the police?": "anger", "No!  I got so flustered and kind of paniked.  ": "sadness", "Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty": "sadness", "Guess what!  I nailed my review for this year and got a raise!": "joy", "That's great!

I am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!": "joy", "Ooh, will you be managing anyone?": "joy", "I freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning": "anger", "I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?": "sadness", "Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!": "joy", "Ugh! Were you away from home?": "sadness", "Right outside the office and with no spare clothes!": "anger", "My stepdaughter graduated from college in May and got a job in San Francisco making 3 times more than I have ever made.": "joy", "Oh wow, she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you, but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.": "joy", "I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.": "joy", "Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!": "joy", "I'm maybe a little jealous, but I know how hard she works and how smart she has been with her decisions.": "anger", "Whew. I finally got all of my work done for the day.": "joy", "That is a good feeling!": "joy", "It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.": "joy", "Nice! No kids at home?": "joy", "Nope, just me. So it's nice and quiet.": "sadness", "I am so nervous.  I have to go to the dentist tomorrow to get a filling replaced. ": "fear", "Are you afraid of the dentist?": "fear", "I am!  I had a bad experience with one when I was younger.": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine.": "fear", "I spoke at a conference recently. I was a little scared going into it but felt great as I knew I knew my speech.": "joy", "Oh nice! That's super brave of you.": "trust", "I'm actually one of those fortunate people who doesn't have a fear of public speaking. ": "fear", "That's a great skill to have!": "surprise", "I was cleaning out my attic and found a box full of old photo albums. I spent the next few hours looking at old photos and having a great time.": "sadness", "That must have been a nice feeling. ": "trust", "It really was. I miss a lot of the people in the photos, made me really smile to see their faces again.": "sadness", "I love that nostalgic feeling. ": "sadness", "I am so irritated.  My dog keeps trying to eat up my shoes no matter where I put them!": "anger", "Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?": "trust", "Yeah she's only about six months.  Despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves...": "anger", "Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.": "sadness", "My husband works late at night and sometimes I'm stuck by myself.": "sadness", "Why he is working late?": "anger", "He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong, he is forced to stay to fix the issue.": "anger", "I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?": "sadness", "That's a good idea! Maybe I can have a boardgame night or something!": "fear", "My aunt just signed for my cousin to get an FJ Cruiser! That is my dream car!

Any big planes?": "joy", "Nothing too big, probably just wander around town": "sadness", "That will be nice to catch up.": "joy", "I'm so irritated at my neighbor. She moved out recently and left ALL her garbage and old furniture in our parking lot by the garbage.": "anger", "That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!": "anger", "Not at all, that's what is so weird! She was really polite, quiet, and neat.": "sadness", "I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off.": "anger", "I am! But whatever, nothing we can do but have the city come pick it up I guess.": "sadness", "Last week the plant I work at was hit with massive layoffs. ": "anger", "Oh no! That is terrible!": "anger", "I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job, I am happy but very sad for the others.": "sadness", "I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!": "anger", "Two years ago my wife and I got divorced. It has been very odd in this big house all by myself.": "sadness", "How do you feel these days?": "sadness", "It has gotten a little better with time, but still a pretty sore spot for me.": "anger", "It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?": "sadness", "I lost my job earlier this year. I was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job.": "fear", "Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?": "sadness", "Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!": "joy", "Wow! That's like a paid vacation!": "joy", "Haha that's an awesome way to think about it!": "joy", "Last week a friend of mine won $2000 on a scratch off ticket. I buy those things all the time and never win squat.": "anger", "Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret? ": "trust", "Right place, right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.": "anger", "Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!": "surprise", "My niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that's going around": "sadness", "That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!": "sadness", "I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.": "sadness", "I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. ": "sadness", "My phone went missing. Imagine my surprise when I got a Facebook message \"from myself,\" it was the person who found it saying \"I have your phone.\"": "surprise", "Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?": "fear", "I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.": "trust", "You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.": "sadness", "Very! Lucky for me it was a cheap phone, I think if I had the newest iPhone or something I would have never seen it again.": "joy", "I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated, just out of curiosity.": "trust", "Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?": "joy", "Nah, although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.": "anger", "Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.": "sadness", "My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before.": "surprise", "Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?": "joy", "She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.": "sadness", "I have a 10 year old like that.": "sadness", "My daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer. We just found out that she made the team!": "surprise", "that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding": "joy", "It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!": "joy", "that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.": "surprise", "thank you!": "joy", "you are very welcome. good luck!": "trust", "My grandma threw away my high school yearbooks.": "sadness", "That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!": "sadness", "I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?": "anger", "Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. ": "sadness", "Good suggestion! Really I wanted to keep all the signatures and notes from my friends but oh well. I will see them next month for our reunion anyway!": "sadness", "We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.": "sadness", "I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February, so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?": "sadness", "It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter": "sadness", "I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.": "trust", "I completely agree. I broke down just watching her cry at the spot where we buried him. I'm not sure if I want to get another dog yet. We have chickens so she's began to show them more attention now.": "sadness", "I bought my daughter her first cell phone. It's a lot of responsibility for her. I hope she is ready for it.": "joy", "I am sure she will be smart with it": "joy", "I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone": "sadness", "You can always show her the ways": "sadness", "This is true! I also put an app on her phone to block things she's not old enough to use": "anger", "I accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day.": "sadness", "Were they okay?": "sadness", "Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.": "sadness", "At least you're not getting sued": "sadness", "Oh man, that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!": "anger", "Im good at that lol": "joy", "I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear.": "fear", "Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.": "fear", "This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared": "joy", "I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.": "joy", "Have you ever went. When you looking down from 15,000 feet you get scared.": "fear", "We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out!": "fear", "I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?": "sadness", "Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up, it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.": "sadness", "I am not sure I would do well in that house": "fear", "It is really creepy! ": "fear", "After my mom passed away I found all our old cassette tapes in her storage, listening to those was pretty cool.": "sadness", "Bet that brought back good memories.": "sadness", "Definitely, brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.": "sadness", "Where did you guys usually go?": "joy", "Everywhere! Sometimes we just hopped in the car and went like two or three hours from home just to do something for the day.": "anger", "I've spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend. I'm exhausted.": "joy", "whats the competition on ?": "joy", "Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.": "sadness", "Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further ": "joy", "I'm so angry at my self. I was in my performance review today and I passed wind in front of my boss. OMG ": "anger", "I wonder how that was noted on your report.": "anger", "I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement. ": "sadness", "Sounds like a wacky place to work.": "anger", "I got a raise today. I've pushed my self hard this last year and I deserve it.": "joy", "That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.": "joy", "Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!": "sadness", "Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.": "joy", "For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.": "fear", "Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?": "sadness", "I don't think so, it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.": "fear", "I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!": "fear", "I told my daughter she wasn't allowed to watch Youtube because it's hard to monitor. I caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!": "sadness", "Its so hard to monitor that stuff now": "anger", "It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.": "disgusted", "Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too": "fear", "I walk my dog for 30 minutes at a time but no matter what, he always ends up using the bathroom inside! I wish he would left me know if he needs to go out.": "anger", "On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?": "anger", "No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!": "anger", "Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.": "disgusted", "That's not a bad idea!": "sadness", "My neighbor stole a package from me.": "anger", "No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.": "anger", "So check this out, I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it, the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!": "anger", "Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.": "anger", "Yeah, I'm pretty livid. I think I will report him to our HOA and see what they say.": "anger", "I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone.

": "sadness", "My coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week.": "anger", "What kind of job was it": "joy", "Sales, so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.": "anger", "Sales do sound hard to do": "joy", "My cat got sick the other day, he was really pathetic. I felt so bad for him.": "sadness", "Is he going to be okay": "trust", "Yes, thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.": "trust", "I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain": "sadness", "My friend is a single mom who works full time. She just graduated college!": "joy", "That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.": "surprise", "Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha": "joy", "Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.": "anger", "I think I got my coworker in trouble.": "anger", "Why? Were they not working?": "sadness", "He called in sick, but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick, I thought he was just out. So, I accidentally told my boss where he was.": "sadness", "He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.": "anger", "Thanks, that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!": "trust", "Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?": "anger", "Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in.": "anticipation", "That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?": "trust", "Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.": "joy", "Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!": "joy", "Drove past the area my Middle school was in today. It was gone. I hated it when I was in school but now that's it gone I'm sad": "sadness", "yea funny how that happens": "sadness", "It was not even that long ago I went to that school. It's been less then 10 years. They did not even build anything. It's a park now.": "sadness", "well at least its being put to good use": "sadness", "I'm going to job interview Thursday. I'm currently employed but I'm ready to move on.": "joy", "Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?": "joy", "Yes, I'm currently in middle management this would be the next step up. I'm excited and nervous ": "fear", "Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?": "joy", "My cousin passed the CPA exam!": "surprise", "Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?": "surprise", "She's already working at a Big 4 firm so she's just going to stick with that for a few years. I'm proud of her, it wasn't easy!": "joy", "Good.

I hope she does a great job.": "anticipation", "lol why do you have to steer clear?": "fear", "I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home. ": "fear", "ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!": "joy", "The other weekend I really wanted to go out, but I realized I don't have any good friends left.": "sadness", "That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?": "sadness", "Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.": "sadness", "Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.": "sadness", "The other day I was short on cash I needed to pay my phone bill. ": "trust", "It can be hard these days, money is tight": "sadness", "So true. I lucked out though and found a $20 bill on the ground! I hope the person who lost it didn't need it really bad because it definitely helped me out.": "anger", "I bet that was a nice surprise": "surprise", "I lost my credit card this weekend and then in the worst place Walmart.": "sadness", "Did you get it all straightened out?": "disgusted", "Yes I was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it I was very grateful.

Have you spoken to her about it?": "disgusted", "It's revolting. I reported her to the HOA but she keeps doing it. I'm going to say something if I catch her out there letting her dog out.": "disgusted", "I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!": "disgusted", "The other day I made fish tacos and did nothing else all day but relax on the couch.": "joy", "Bet that was a nice calming down.": "joy", "Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure, just how I like it.": "joy", "Did you get up to anything else fun?": "joy", "Not doing anything WAS my idea of fun!": "joy", "I did a walk a thon last week for back to school drive and needy kids it was s long walk but I finished it I felt so happy. ": "joy", "That sounds awesome, i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.": "joy", "I did before the walk I was un-assured I would finish but I did so I was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money. ": "joy", "Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!": "fear", "Went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day. Saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt.": "disgusted", "Oh gross, I would lose my appetite": "disgusted", "It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.": "disgusted", "Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether": "disgusted", "I am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago.": "fear", "Oh my goodness, that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?": "fear", "When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones.

My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.": "fear", "I will stay clear of them all not taking any chances. ": "joy", "I'm a neat freak and my house has to stay clean and in place always such a pet peeve of mines.

": "joy", "My supervisor totally stole all the credit for a client I brought in.": "anger", "That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?": "anger", "I totally did. And let the CEO know about his behavior.": "disgusted", "I hope he got in trouble!": "anger", "Unfortunately no, the CEO thinks he can do no wrong.

Did you ever catch the culprit?": "anger", "No, they didn't leave a insurance card or anything, just drove off. Some people are so worthless.": "anger", "Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?": "anger", "Last month my dog Skippy passed away. He was 18 years old.": "sadness", "Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.": "sadness", "Man it's hard.

I hope fond memories of him get you through this.": "sadness", "I waited the longest three weeks of my life to get something I ordered online.": "anticipation", "That can be so aggravating.

My god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out.": "fear", "Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! ": "fear", "This has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area. This past spring we spent 5 hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area.": "joy", "That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!": "fear", "Yes, a lot of people don't have basements, and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark, scary place, especially when the power is all out.": "fear", "Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!": "sadness", "I was in the grocery store. I found what I needed on the top shelf.

I got him when he was just a puppy 17 years ago.": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog": "sadness", "Yeah, we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.": "anger", "That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point": "anger", "I was driving around my old neighborhood and seen that the house I grew up in had burned down.": "sadness", "That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?": "sadness", "I spent birth till I was 17 living there, so literally all of my child hood memories.

That's a bit of a strange story.": "sadness", "Back when I was in college, I crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket.": "joy", "I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.": "anger", "Exactly, especially when you get one for just walking.": "fear", "Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.": "sadness", "My wife and I are going to buy are very first brand new car this week.": "joy", "Cool, what are you getting?": "joy", "A Chevy Cruze.

Had a great time.": "sadness", "Well, I finally got a call back from that job I interviewed for the other day.": "sadness", "Awesome news!  What was the response?": "joy", "Well, they decided not to hire me. This stinks.": "anger", "Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.

Do you have any way of finding out who did it?": "anger", "No, I called the police but it's almost impossible to track.

I mean, who would steal a mower?": "anger", "My food had hair in it at a restaurant worst experience ever.": "disgusted", "what did you do?": "sadness", "I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite.

": "sadness", "My wife is going away on a business trip soon.... she'll be gone for a couple of weeks.": "anticipation", "That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?": "sadness", "Well, I might do some work on the house. But it's going to be awfully quiet around here.": "sadness", "I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.": "joy", "Ugh, my neighbor keeps playing his music really loud at night when I'm trying to sleep.": "anger", "spray water over there": "anger", "Ha, that's not a bad idea.

That's why I'm so nervous about it.": "fear", "Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead.

Can you still read the words on it?": "sadness", "The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.  Maybe I'll frame it someday.": "anger", "I was going to say, yeah, that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office.

": "joy", "snowmen are my favourite! ": "joy", "I always get sad though when they melt ": "sadness", "Last week I was walking and talking to one of my coworkers and I stepped into a hole I did not see on the job site. I ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client.": "sadness", "Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?": "sadness", "Yeah, my coworker did, but the damage had already been done. Pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client.": "sadness", "Of course! Well, at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.": "sadness", "We have had a record number of tornadoes in my area so far this year. My son really hates going into the basement while it is storming outside.": "joy", "That sounds really scary!

I hope he learns to cope with it.": "anger", "I had a client meeting in Dallas, and as I was driving to the airport I heard there was going to be a lot of storms we'd be flying through. I ended up renting a car because I hate flying so much in just calm weather.": "fear", "That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?": "fear", "I have, but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.": "fear", "I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped. ": "fear", "Last month, this area got pounded with rainfall. My entire home town was flooded and declared a disaster area.": "fear", "Wow. That's intense.

Are the damages covered by an insurance?": "anger", "Yes, we had insurance that is going to cover it, but it still sucks start from ground zero. Plus, insurance can't really replace some things.": "sadness", "I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.": "sadness", "My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster.": "fear", "Interesting....did you do it": "joy", "Yeah, but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it.": "fear", "lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end": "sadness", "My husband is so lucky I cheat on him like he did.": "trust", "Why do you cheat on him?": "trust", "I could have.

He had a heart attack while he slept.": "sadness", "that's terrible! how does that make you feel?": "sadness", "It makes me feel old. I mean I am not that old, but to see people my age passing away really makes me think about my own mortality. ": "sadness", "That is the reality of life, unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now.": "sadness", "I am upset I have to tell my daughter her pet died.": "sadness", "That is terrible.

Talking smack to each other": "anger", "You're right I'm going to be even louder next time.": "anger", "I dislike a careless driver and this morning I was furious with one by my daughters elementary school. ": "anger", "Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around": "anger", "I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt.": "fear", "Thats awful!

How is he still employed?": "trust", "He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.

I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.": "sadness", "I told my best friends about an incident in where I self-harmed recently.": "sadness", "I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings.

I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.": "disgusted", "That's a good idea, I just haven't found a nice looking one yet. It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.": "sadness", "We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it.

I really feel like this is the right move for the next steps for us and our relationship.": "trust", "That's great! How long have you two been together?": "joy", "Almost a year.  We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.": "sadness", "You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.": "trust", "A friend of mine hadn't taken out her garbage in weeks.": "anger", "Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.": "disgusted", "You got that right. Also there were so many fruit flies around it, I felt sick to my stomach.": "disgusted", "Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.": "disgusted", "I really hate moving.

Can't believe I found one in my small suburban neighborhood.": "fear", "Oh, that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.": "sadness", "My little brother was stuck gaming on a horrendously slow computer for years.": "sadness", "That's not much fun.

How lucky we are!": "trust", "My older sister stole money from me.": "anger", "Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.": "sadness", "Yeah, no one else in the household would ever do something like that. The worst thing is, my parents did nothing about it.": "anger", "That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.": "sadness", "Today I woke from an amazing dream which i had, it brought back a lot of amazing memories, memories which i wish i could go back to...": "sadness", "I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it's stuff you miss!": "sadness", "Yeah, but at the same time, it motivated me for the day which was nice": "joy", "Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?": "joy", "to keep on dreaming and follow my heart, in other words, me chasing after what i love": "joy", "Last week as we were finishing up on a job site, the client was over joyed at the way we had done the installation. I couldn't help but keep smiling since it was my design.": "joy", "That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.": "joy", "Yes, it is great to see something you designed be put into a working model. ": "joy", "You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.": "joy", "i was just like the usual, working on my website, and then i saw a disgusting advert which was about society": "disgusted", "Dont put too much weight into those advertisements.

Sometimes they can really get under your skin.": "disgusted", "My girlfriend moved in over the weekend.  We have a ton of boxes to unpack but I am thinking it should be something that can be done in the next couple weeks.": "sadness", "Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy. I would just unpack the necessities first and move from there.": "joy", "I think thats the plan.  After those were just slowly going to go from room to room until everything is done.  Not a huge rush and were both super happy...well I am.  I'm assuming she is too!": "joy", "Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!": "joy", "today i woke up, and i realised that i am more than content with my life, it made me happy and peaceful ": "joy", "That would be a great feeling.  Did something happen to make you feel more content?": "joy", "yes, i just realised i have everything i ever wanted in my life": "joy", "Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.": "joy", "Im going to Chicago in a couple weeks.  I havent been there for about 15 years so I'm really looking forward to it.": "anticipation", "oh nice! i know that feeling, is it home? what made you think about going there?": "joy", "It isnt home but I went there for family trips when I was younger.

": "anger", "Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?": "sadness", "well the library is very small so limited seats so I had to sit there and listen to it. I was so frusterated": "joy", "That was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners.": "disgusted", "Yah I agree. I could understand if it was not so quiet and an open place. I can still hear it in my ear now!": "sadness", "So this weekend Im going to do a marathon. I have worked very hard to get myself ready for it": "joy", "That's so exciting!

Now no more driving when your sleepy.": "anger", "Yeah im very thankful I didnt crash last night. ": "trust", "My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep. ": "anger", "That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep.": "anger", "I'm not trying to get arrested! I think I'll just wait things out until I move in two months.": "anticipation", "I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays.

I bought her a cell phone for her birthday this year. She is becoming a responsible young preteen": "joy", "Wow, watching kids grow up is hard.

So much wasted time!": "anger", "I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that.

With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!": "joy", "I saw a man slap his dog on the sidewalk a few times while I was on the bus.": "disgusted", "Holy cow!

But at that time, I felt so sick seeing what was happening to my jacket that I thought I was going to puke next.": "disgusted", "That is a really rough story, You should make him pay for another one.": "sadness", "A few months ago, a good friend of mine that I look up to attempted suicide.": "fear", "damn, is he ok now?": "sadness", "Thankfully he is.

HOwever he ended up cheating on me": "trust", "That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me, the guilt would destroy me.": "sadness", "It would me too, not only that but he just up and got with her like I never existed to him.   Its funny because he always accused me of cheating on him and I had no clue why.  It was him the whole time!": "anger", "Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.": "sadness", "He kept doing drugs, and taking things that didnt belong to him.  It broke my heart but I didnt know what else to do.": "sadness", "It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...": "sadness", "Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk.": "sadness", "You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.": "sadness", "today after coming back from work i saw my wife and she was asking me why are you late with questioning eyes, i told her that i wen't to go and get her favourite meal, i felt so faithful ": "trust", "Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?": "sadness", "she was joking about it, but she was so happy afterwards and we ate together, it was such a nice day": "sadness", "It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.": "joy", "after a long day from work, i was stuck at this math problem, but then i decided to go for a walk instead of working on the problem, i trust my guts, after i had come back from the walk, the solution kicked in and i was able to do the problem": "fear", "That's inspiring, has that worked for you in the past in the same way?": "surprise", "yes always, it is something that works for me": "joy", "That's so cool, you seem very intuitive": "surprise", "it was 3am, i was walking at the utter night... i was scared out of my mind... anything could happen, my walking speed increased... and everything i was seeing suddenly became more and more scary": "fear", "That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?": "fear", "in the end yes.. but the journey was sure hell": "sadness", "Why were you walking so late at night?": "fear", "today i realised the small details of my life and i feel more satisfied": "joy", "Nice, what are some things you realized?": "joy", "that i have everything i wished for.": "anger", "You don't have me yet <3": "sadness", "One time I bought water and snacks before a hurricane came to wreck my city": "joy", "oh god, how did you . have the courage to even go outside?": "fear", "My house flooded so I had to get on my roof !": "fear", "that sounds like an adventurous day ": "joy", "One time they put cheese in my hamburger when I told them not to!": "sadness", "Wow, how could they do that?": "anger", "They are complete monsters I tell ya!": "fear", "Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!": "disgusted", "i lied to my mother and i feel very uneasy": "fear", "You should.

": "surprise", "an interesting one, what does this make you feel ?": "sadness", "Well at first I thought it was cute until I saw him at the gas station the other day.  I overheard him asking someone that was getting gas if he happened to have a little change he could have.  He needed to get home in his lawnmower but didn't have the money to do so.   I ended up giving him 3 bucks.": "anger", "oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?": "sadness", "i believe i am a really caring person, because i always take care of cats and feed them and lately they are more and more close to me": "trust", "That is so kind of you, I also a have a soft heart for animals.

Ew!": "disgusted", "I think I would leave if I saw something like that.": "disgusted", "I left as fast as possible!": "sadness", "Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?": "sadness", "Nope, just you!": "joy", "It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.": "trust", "One time I was so nervous to look at my grade for my final exam": "fear", "I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account, how's school going?": "sadness", "I failed and dropped out!

I have not seen her i a long time.We went through alot together. It was nostalgic to me. ": "sadness", "Aww yeah, those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! ": "sadness", "I agree! We have alot of things to catch up on. ": "joy", "being alive is so much stress and anxiety, why does it have to be like this? why can't we just all express our individual selves, instead we are forced to work so that we can eat ": "fear", "It's not fair, eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same? ": "joy", "Yes, it's true we all know this inside out, but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives, the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting, if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life, not one which just gives the impression of freedom, that's all there is now, faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings": "sadness", "Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another.": "sadness", "I watched a movie the other night that really got me in my feelings.": "sadness", "Oh wow, what ovie was it and how did it make you feel?

But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.": "anger", "My grandma ended up getting really sick this last week.": "sadness", "Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? ": "sadness", "She is getting much better.

Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?": "joy", "no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her, but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart  ": "sadness", "Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon": "joy", "I had a terrible experience at the grocery store today.": "anger", "Oh no what happened, are you alright?

": "surprise", "i am so afraid... afraid that i am not giving too much to the world, what if i parish not having done anything?": "fear", "I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters, if we make a difference or not, we all end up dust in the end.": "fear", "no, i don't believe that, whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage, just like birth death is a process": "sadness", "If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.": "sadness", "Not necessarily,  while it's true you have your traditional christian or Muslim that preach the afterlife as some miracle and hell, scaring people into not being themselves, but death isn't a scary phase, and i don't care about whether i am going to die, as that is just the ego trying to cling on and survive, i've passed that point, but after looking clearly you'll see there is more than just this dimension and that is just a simple fact, science tells us this too, it's not about feeling good or feeling comfortable with death, it's about growing ": "fear", "the world is such a disgusting place now, i wish i was born back in the 70s ": "sadness", "Yeah, 70s were incredible, the dancing the cars, the women had style and the music was incredible.": "surprise", "RIGHT?! but now is just so bad, i wish i could go back": "sadness", "But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.": "joy", "today everyone said congratulations to me, as i succeed in making an amazing app, and now i am so greatful to be alive! ": "joy", "Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.": "joy", "thank you! it's always nice to tell you these things, you don't get jealous and you are just happy for me, thank you": "joy", "There will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.": "anger", "I came home from work today to a disaster. My dog chewed up the new couch i just purchased.": "sadness", "Oh no, can you return it or get a refund?": "sadness", "No I didnt purchase insurance. When i saw it my blood was boiling!": "anger", "I am sorry to hear that, I would have felt the same way. ": "sadness", "yeah. Im so upset i cant even think right nowl": "anger", "I gave my dog away to a family today. I did not have time for him since work and school take alot of it up.": "sadness", "That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.": "sadness", "I agree, but im praying they will take care of him. hes just a puppy.": "trust", "I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!": "joy", "Yeah thats all i can ask for.": "joy", "I saw my girlfriend getting real friendly with another guy at the bar last night": "anger", "OH no! Are you the jealous type?": "anger", "It definitely had me feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation.": "fear", "OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!": "fear", "I have a test coming up next week.": "joy", "oh no do you feel ready for it? ": "joy", "I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.": "joy", "That is great, I believe that you will do amazing! ": "joy", "I AM SO ANNOYED! i have been trying to solve this math problem for 2 hours now": "joy", "Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?": "anger", "there isn't any solution it's a century award i am working on, it's the problem of non-polynomial descent ": "joy", "Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.": "joy", "I'm really feeling alright about how my life is going right now.": "sadness", "That is great, what has been going on in your life recently?": "joy", "I've just been getting things done. Nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either.": "joy", "That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :) ": "joy", "The ads for the new World Of Warcraft expansion really makes me think about when I played it many years ago.": "joy", "They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?": "joy", "It does. I put so much time in that game before. I might have to pick it up again.": "sadness", "If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.": "sadness", "I woke up to something super annoying this morning.": "anger", "That is always frustrating. What happened?": "anger", "I woke up to find out my car was sideswiped while it was parked by the curb during the night. No note or anything.": "anger", "Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.": "anger", "I'm really disappointed in my son's actions that I was told about.": "sadness", "What did he do?": "surprise", "He got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day.": "sadness", "Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?": "anger", "Probably because he did not study enough so was unprepared.": "sadness", "I ate such a disgusting thing the other day by accident.": "disgusted", "What was it that you accidentally ate?": "sadness", "I bought a sandwich and after a few bite I noticed that there was a bunch of mold.": "disgusted", "Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?": "disgusted", "I was!": "surprise", "I recently had my first child.  I was absolutely terrified when I went into labour but I put all my faith in the wonderful midwives and everything worked out perfectly!": "joy", "I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.": "joy", "it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career, its not just a job but a vocation.": "joy", "You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody, I agree.": "trust", "Indeed.  The really do work with life and death everyday.": "trust", "I started a diet today and just as soon as I get home I eat a burger!": "surprise", "I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?": "sadness", "Fried foods. I feel bad I didn't commit to it the first day. ": "sadness", "Don't be too hard on yourself, it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying, I believe in you!": "sadness", "Thank you! I need that motivation so I can get over this shame im feeling. ": "sadness", "I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!": "joy", "I'm so not looking forward to tomorrow.": "anticipation", "Why not? What happens tomorrow?": "fear", "I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow. ": "anger", "Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!": "sadness", "I changed my shift to overnight and walking to my care gave me the creeps tonight. There was a man standing in the dark.": "fear", "That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!": "fear", "I agree. I had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine.

I've been really worried.": "anticipation", "I am sure the procedure will go excellently.": "fear", "Today my friend had all of is awe, becasue she won the singing contest at work. She is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing. ": "anger", "That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!": "surprise", "I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.": "surprise", "That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.": "surprise", "I hope so. She is very talented. Who would have known. ": "surprise", "I have such a fear of flying, so you can just imagine how I felt when my husband bought us a sky diving voucher for my 30th birthday! He was so excited and I was so nervous and uneasy.": "fear", "He's a brave man. How was the experience?": "trust", "Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.  Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time, i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out, it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!": "trust", "It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!": "fear", "It certainly did.  I would definitely recommend it.  My husband though is another story.  He has a fear of the sea and underwater so you can just guess what I will be buying him for his next big birthday haha.": "fear", "I was so worried that I could not pay for my tuition this semester.

I cant be more happy and excited to be done!": "joy", "I was doing a big clear out recently and stumbled accross my old high school year book.  It is a long time since I left school and couldnt believe I even still had it.  Such a feeling of nostalgia looking at the old photos and reading the stories.": "sadness", "Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?": "sadness", "Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those, especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.": "sadness", "It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.": "sadness", "Indeed.  It definitely made my clear out day much more enjoyable.": "joy", "So i just bought a brand new corvette and I let my friend barrow it to go out of town. ": "trust", "That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.": "surprise", "I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol": "trust", "I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.": "anticipation", "Yeah it does. I never let anybody drive my car, but I felt I could let her since she is responsible. ": "trust", "My husband wont be back for a month due to work and Im here at the house by myself.": "sadness", "Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.": "sadness", "Yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house. ": "sadness", "Do you get nervous being on your own?": "joy", "Nah just bored.

Did you get the police involved?": "anger", "Well yes.  While i was in my daze, absolutely horrified, my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.": "joy", "Yeah i would have felt the same way. ": "sadness", "Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!": "anger", "yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.": "fear", "true but in time I finally did see that its not the end of the world, its just a car that can be replaced but that initial overwhelming feeling was awful.": "sadness", "Today after a long day at work I sat in traffic for 2 hours due to construction on the freeway!": "anger", "That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon": "anger", "Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks.

My initial reaction was to contact the local pet shelter.  However no one had reported him.  I decided to take him in, wash him and feed him.  I have never been much of an animal person but I couldnt believe how much i felt for this poor wee puppy.": "trust", "Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?": "trust", "I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him, even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward, I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!": "trust", "The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! ": "trust", "Just as he does to us.": "anger", "I got super wasted. I accidentally messed myself in front of people": "sadness", "Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.": "sadness", "Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink": "sadness", "That sounds like a good decision.

I hope she's forgiven you since then.": "sadness", "oh yes she has, it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!": "sadness", "That's probably a good idea.": "sadness", "Yes just a pity I had to learn the hard way.": "sadness", "My last day of work was yesterday. I got so emotional driving home and I cried.": "sadness", "I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?": "sadness", "Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone. ": "sadness", "Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.": "sadness", "Yeah just thinking about it makes me want to tear up. ": "anger", "Yesterday I found my boyfriend with someone else!": "sadness", "hmmn, really?..i guess you must have felt very bad": "sadness", "I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.": "anger", "am so sorry about that, did he apologize?": "sadness", "He doesnt know I know, but he will soon when i throw his stuff out": "anger", "One time when I was younger I wore a Halloween costume that I'd been looking forward to show off.  But I ended up covering myself up with a cape, because I was self conscious of how I looked.": "sadness", "Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?": "sadness", "Well the costume itself ended up looking great, since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it, so I felt bad.": "sadness", "It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. ": "sadness", "That's true, but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.": "fear", "Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.": "joy", "Whom do you belive the most": "sadness", "In reference to what?": "sadness", "Your trustful person?": "trust", "My husband is my most trusted companion.": "sadness", "Oh, How much did you like him": "joy", "my father couldn't stope any lower, how can someone take money from their own child": "sadness", "That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?": "anger", "i did many times, but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything": "sadness", "How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.": "anger", "my wife is always there for me, so i trust her more than anybody and i dont want to have any friends otehr than her, she is my faith": "trust", "That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends.": "trust", "that's only normie talk, we are both introverted and we hate people": "sadness", "Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.": "sadness", "i am a joke, i am ashemed of what i did": "sadness", "what did you do???": "sadness", "i builied someone because they made fun of my mother, but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can't believe i did that": "anticipation", "well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers": "sadness", "I  waited 3 years for them to realise season 3 and they promised it was to be released today, i was so devastated when i found out that they had to postpone it even more :/ it's just so annoying": "sadness", "stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later": "anticipation", "i hope so :<": "sadness", "it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.": "fear", "I still have a favorite stuffed animal of mine that I've had since I was young.  It's still in pretty good condition and reminds me a lot of my childhood.": "sadness", "That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. ": "sadness", "Yeah, it is.  I always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it's even more special.": "sadness", "That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. ": "joy", "a young girl, crying, sadden by the cruelity of our elders, told me about all these feelings i began to cry and became very sentimental": "sadness", "....what feelings? what are you talking about": "sadness", "she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset": "anger", "oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?": "sadness", "i am so envious of my sister, she has everything i just want to make her life hell": "anger", "That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with": "anger", "yeah but only i should get everything! no one else": "sadness", "Other people deserve to have things, too.": "anger", "i am so embaressed at myself... i cant believe i fell down the stairs and my pants fell and my behind was exposed to the whole crowd ": "sadness", "Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, \"Safe!\"": "disgusted", "indeed, but this time i was red and yelling in my head": "anger", "Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. ": "sadness", "don't you think life is peaceful? are you content?": "joy", "eh not really. what about you": "sadness", "i did, espcially today when i woke up, i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can't just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that, so i decided to work hard on becoming free": "joy", "and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?": "sadness", "i will work on the things i enjoy, which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often": "joy", "i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors": "joy", "I've known my best friend since I was 4 years old.  He joined the Air Force after high school and moved out of state and I was really upset when he left.": "sadness", "Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?": "sadness", "Oh yeah, we still keep in contact over the Internet daily and visit each other every few years.  But I miss when we used to hang out every day.": "sadness", "I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. ": "sadness", "the future is so uncertain and yet so certain i am so not ready for what's about to come it fills mee with anxiety and depression just thinking about it": "fear", "Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. ": "fear", "i hope so": "sadness", "If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on. ": "fear", "I have been spending a year learning a new skill and after so much study and hard work it is finally paying off. I am feeling faithful again. ": "trust", "that is great.. may i know what you have learnt": "trust", "I have been learning to trade on the Forex markets.": "anticipation", "it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it": "joy", "Thank you sir, have a great day!": "joy", "great day to you too": "joy", "i am so prepared the exam tomorrow!": "joy", "How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!": "joy", "yup but i have been studying since for a year ": "joy", "You sound very confident!

You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?": "sadness", "no, i can't i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem": "anger", "Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.": "sadness", "I really hate going to the doctor. I was hesitant about going this time.": "fear", "Why do you need to go to the doctor?": "fear", "I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.": "fear", "Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?": "sadness", "I was planning on going to grad school and I told a lot of people. I ended up not going, and I felt embarrassed every time someone asked me about how school was going.": "sadness", "That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?": "sadness", "Yes. Without really giving details, I always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn't work out.": "anger", "Right. ": "anger", "I found a picture of my daughter and me from when I took her to a waterfall a long time ago. It brought tears to my eyes.": "sadness", "Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?": "sadness", "Yes she does. Of course she doesn't see the sentimentality of it yet as I do. She is only 23. ": "sadness", "One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.": "sadness", "I have the worst fear of carnival rides, i always think they": "fear", "I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?": "fear", "(pressed enter too early). I love thrill rides, but i don't trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up, too many horror stories. I mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions.": "fear", "Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.": "sadness", "My wife's cousin was sent to the hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma with something having to do with his lungs": "fear", "Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?": "sadness", "Yes. They aren't sure what's wrong but his oxygen level is down to 40%": "trust", "I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?": "anticipation", "I was on the highway during a strong thunderstorm, no visibility. I had a bad feeling someone bad was going to happen and no more than 10 minutes later two cars in front of me crash and one gets flipped over.": "fear", "That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition": "fear", "Yeah I honestly don't but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen. A lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason.": "anger", "I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.": "fear", "Walking to a restaurant the other day and I forgot to hold the door open for an old lady, felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too.": "sadness", "It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.": "sadness", "I hope so, i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her.": "sadness", "It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!": "anger", "I bought a new phone recently and not long after i dropped it and shattered the screen, first time this happens and it was just terrible.": "sadness", "Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?": "anger", "No I usually don't since i've never dropped mines but I do get warranty now. It wasn't a cheap repair either.": "anger", "I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.": "sadness", "I was disgusted when my dog tried to attack another dog": "disgusted", "Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school.": "sadness", "Not really, but he knows better. I think I will get a trainer.": "trust", "Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.": "trust", "Saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away, felt nice seeing her on video again.": "sadness", "Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.": "sadness", "Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored.": "sadness", "I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.": "joy", "I got the scores for my final exam. got a B and passed the class, it was a good day to celebrate.": "joy", "That's awesome!  Congratulations!": "joy", "Yeah, i pampered myself and went with some friends to a Japanese sushi place.": "joy", "Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate": "joy", "Ordered a new pair of headphones online. They are a really high end pair so I'm very excited to finally get them.": "anticipation", "That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones": "joy", "Yeah, it really is a day and night difference. Let's you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better.": "sadness", "I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!": "joy", "My wife is having a hard time after finding out we can no longer have children. I am doing my best to support her and care for her but it is very hard when nothing seems to work.": "trust", "Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?": "sadness", "I do but she doesn't. Which makes it harder I think. All I can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal.": "sadness", "I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.": "sadness", "Back in middle school i had a crush on a girl and one day in class she was talking to another guy. I was jealous for a while but it didn't matter anyways. I ended up getting her.": "anger", "Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest.": "sadness", "It is, those were the funnest days. No responsibilities.": "fear", "I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.": "sadness", "I had a lot of feelings when I found pictures of my dog who has passed.": "sadness", "It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone": "sadness", "It was very bittersweet. She could not work her legs anymore due to age.": "sadness", "You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!": "sadness", "I moved to my current town one year ago and I really like it here. I'm happy and couldn't think of a better place to live.": "joy", "Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?": "joy", "It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.": "joy", "That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.": "trust", "Either that, or people are just nosier and love getting into each other's business! Just kidding. I think the slower pace of life just makes people nicer.": "surprise", "I very much could count on my mom to always be there for me.": "trust", "That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.": "trust", "Me too. I am so thankful for her.": "trust", "Is there anything she does specifically for her?": "joy", "I was upset when I failed my math test": "sadness", "I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?": "sadness", "I did, but the material was a hard subject.": "joy", "Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.": "sadness", "I'm glad I can trust my husband to always be there for me.": "trust", "That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?": "trust", "Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@": "anticipation", "That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.": "joy", "Hi friend! Wow, I was so scared of this taxi driver when I was vacationing in Mexico. He looked rather suspicious.": "fear", "Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?": "fear", "No, I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case. ": "sadness", "Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol": "sadness", "Yeah but the car was on the highway and I could not get out. Thankfully everything was alright. Never again though!": "sadness", "I was storing all of my old photos on my new external hard drive yesterday. It made me wish I could go back and time and see some relatives again.": "sadness", "I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.": "sadness", "It's bittersweet! Nice to see their faces again, but sad to miss them.": "sadness", "I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.": "sadness", "I lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn't": "sadness", "Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings": "trust", "I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it.": "sadness", "Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!": "sadness", "Sometimes a fly gets in my apartment and I hold my cat over my head and we chase it. She hasn't scratched or bitten me once while we do this!": "fear", "That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too.": "trust", "I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!": "trust", "Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.": "anger", "I babysat my nephew overnight last weekend. He was scared so I let him sleep in bed with me, even though he kicks a lot.": "joy", "That was thoughtful, sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!": "fear", "Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool, but he's still very much a little kid.": "sadness", "Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.": "sadness", "I'm an auntie :p": "sadness", "My mistake :)": "sadness", "my pet dog is always there for me. No matter what, I can count on her.": "trust", "I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!": "joy", "yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you": "sadness", "I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!": "trust", "I had a great breakfast this morning. It was delicious and I felt very happy and relaxed.": "joy", "Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.": "joy", "Eggs, bacon, strawberries, tomatoes, and coffee. So yummy!": "joy", "Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs...": "sadness", "I called someone by the wrong name earlier today. I didn't really know them and hadn't seen them in ages.": "sadness", "I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.": "sadness", "They were ok with it, but I hope I didn't hurt their feelings.": "sadness", "I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.": "anger", "The other day we were in the front yard, and you won't believe what happened!": "sadness", "What happened? The yard always has mysteries!": "trust", "My 4 year-old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!": "sadness", "Shocking! Has your kid done that before?": "joy", "No!  All of the neighbors were out there, too!": "anger", "I got into an argument with my husband and I realized later that he was right but I never apologized. :(": "sadness", "Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.": "sadness", "Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way.": "sadness", "You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. ": "sadness", "That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :)": "sadness", "Your welcome! Glad I could help!": "trust", "I'm unemployed and struggling right now. I feel really bad when people talk to me about their new stuff, even though they're not trying to be mean": "sadness", "I can understand the feeling, I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.": "sadness", "yeah! I just want to be able to support myself and not go to the food bank or rely on friends and family": "trust", "You'll return to self-sufficiency soon, you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.": "sadness", "I am so sad. My 3 dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries. Crying....": "sadness", "Aww, that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.": "sadness", "It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals.": "sadness", "That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves": "sadness", "Thanks for listening my friend.": "sadness", "One of my love birds had a baby but she is a terrible mother. So I am now taking care of the baby and feeding her everyday. She is so cute!": "trust", "Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example, is it quite tough?": "sadness", "No. The baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy. ": "anger", "Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?": "trust", "Yes! I think so, haha!": "joy", "Keep up the good work!": "joy", "I feel very happy that I moved out in the country. I thought I was a city person but I guess not.": "joy", "I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.": "joy", "Oh yes. It was hard to get used to at first but now I barely notice it.": "sadness", "All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.": "sadness", "Yes I think so. I especially enjoy this night owl that hoo's everynight.": "trust", "Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.": "joy", "Sure does. Your welcome to visit any time my friend.": "sadness", "Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.": "joy", "I really wanted to go on this fruitarian trip to Bali butI could not get off work. My friends went without me": "anticipation", "Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?": "joy", "No. My boss is not a very nice person. I think I should find a new job.": "sadness", "Yeah you might want to look into it then": "sadness", "Thanks for your advice my friend!": "trust", "My dog is feeling sick and I don't know what is wrong.": "sadness", "Oh no!

Let's see how I do next week.": "joy", "I wish you the very best with it all!": "joy", "Thanks my friend!": "trust", "You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard, they don't always turn the way you might hope!": "anticipation", "My dogs keep attacking my poor ducks. I don't know what to do": "anger", "I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.": "anger", "I scream at the dogs and it seems to be working but I never know what can happen in the future.": "fear", "Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.": "anger", "Yep. Talk to later my friend.": "sadness", "I packing to go on an international trip.

But I will double check like you said. :)": "sadness", "Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry": "sadness", "You are so right! See you when I get back my friend!": "trust", "I was ashamed when my dog started barking loudly when I was away.": "sadness", "Why were you ashamed?

I wish all children could have good daddy's.": "sadness", "Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.": "trust", "I have a stuffed animal that my old dog used to lay by/on as a pillow. My dog is dead but I still keep that stuffed animal to remind me of him": "sadness", "I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?": "sadness", "He was about 12.  He was my first dog though! He was a sweetheart.  It is nice keeping something to remind me of him.": "sadness", "I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)": "sadness", "I do too! ": "joy", "I was hoping to get an interview for a higher position and was told I would get that at least.  However, the recruiter didnt look at internal candidates and by the time it was reported they had hired someone from the outside.": "sadness", "Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?": "anger", "My boss said the recruiter is an idiot and just never looked at internal candidates. It was a bummer but I figure I'll look for something else in the company soon": "sadness", "Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.": "anger", "I was a little upset.  My boss and her boss were more angry than me though so I felt good they were at least on my side!": "anger", "I am getting a new car this week! I can't wait to smell the new leather seats!": "joy", "Oh man, that is exciting! Do you know what kind?": "joy", "It's a beautiful 2018 yellow jeep! The car of my dreams! So stoked!": "joy", "That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations, that's great news!": "joy", "A bird fell out of a tree next to my house. I am now the mother and taking care of her. We are developing such a beautiful relationship.": "trust", "That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?": "trust", "I think it is a love bird. She thinks I am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when I call her. I have never had a pet bird before.": "trust", "Aww, I'd love to see a video of that.": "sadness", "Ok, I will make one for you. :)": "joy", "I met a cow the other day and I went to go pet her. Something inside me told me to get away. Later that day the owner told me to stay away from her because she is known to attack people.": "sadness", "You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.": "sadness", "Yes I think so. That probably could have killed me. But I guess it was not my time. I angels saved me.": "sadness", "Good thing you listened to your gut feeling": "surprise", "I need to go to the grocery store but it is storming outside. Not sure if I should go or not.": "fear", "Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.": "sadness", "Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.": "anger", "Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.": "surprise", "i came home yesterday, i found my sofa torn up, let's say this I am not very  happy with my pet dog": "sadness", "Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble.

I hope he is better for you in the future.": "sadness", "I am so hurt that my baby goat died. My dogs were playing to rough and killer her. Man I should have stopped it sooner. It is all my fault. :(": "sadness", "Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself, animals like to play with each other!": "sadness", "Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.": "trust", "That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.": "anger", "I went fishing with my 4 year-old about a month ago.": "surprise", "That sounds great, I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?": "surprise", "He did!  He caught 4 fish all by himself.": "surprise", "Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.": "surprise", "My dog was stung by a bug.  His lip got huge and looked really funny but I felt terrible for him!": "anger", "Poor doggy!

I hope I am never homeless.": "sadness", "I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.": "sadness", "Yeah especially when it is snowing outside. Can you just imagine having to sleep outside like that . Oh! So sad!": "sadness", "It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing": "sadness", "I went out to eat with my girlfriend last week.  It was an awesome atmosphere and the food was great!": "joy", "That sounds fun! Where did you go?": "joy", "We went to a greek place.  There were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers. I think we'll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!": "surprise", "Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!": "joy", "as I walk through my house, the rooms are empty, There is no one there for me": "fear", "I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.": "sadness", "that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with": "sadness", "I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.": "sadness", "I have no children but I have a ton of animals. I love them all so much. They are my children.": "trust", "What kinds of pets do you have?": "trust", "I have chickens, ducks, parrots, cockatiels, budgies, peacocks, guinea pigs, dogs, goats and cows. haha ": "sadness", "oh wow! you did say a ton!

I feel so dirty today. :(": "sadness", "Oh wow, are you going to be in front of anyone important?": "joy", "Not today. I just feel insecure about it, like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.": "anger", "Usually, you are the one who notices it the most. ": "sadness", "My cows are finally pregnant. I can't wait for my baby calves to be born!": "joy", "wow, that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too, i presume.": "joy", "Oh, yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.": "disgusted", "very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun": "joy", "i miss my old pet dog, i feel so empty without her around": "sadness", "Awww, I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. ": "trust", "i know that what makes it harder not having her around, no companionship": "sadness", "Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.": "sadness", "I am so envious of those that can travel the world and get paid for it.": "anger", "That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!": "sadness", "Yeah, maybe in my next life I guess, haha.": "sadness", "Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one. ": "sadness", "When I was in high school there was a senior I had a crush on and I was a sophomore.  I ended up asking her out but got rejected.

You never know maybe one day yall will be married": "sadness", "Haha, I hope not...my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! She's a nice person (the one from high school) but I dont think I could ever marry her": "sadness", "you dont still have any feelings at all for her?": "sadness", "I am learning how sew my own clothes. I am studying hard and I think I will be able to make my first outfit!": "joy", "Ooh, I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!": "joy", "Yes, I have so many ideas!

I might just have to learn how to do that myself.": "sadness", "I just made a huge feast and now I am excited for all my guests to arrive to my baby shower!": "joy", "Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. ": "joy", "Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.": "joy", "Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.": "joy", "I trust the way my body feels to know if I'm generally healthy or not": "trust", "Usually it will let you know if something is wrong.

The human body is interesting!": "surprise", "It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.": "joy", "I went to a restaurant and after I got the bill I realized that I did not have my wallet on me! The manager was yelling at me demanding me to pay before I left.": "anger", "Oh no, how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. ": "anger", "Yes, he did want to get paid but I needed to go home and get my wallet. He got angry with me but what could I do? I had no money with me.": "anger", "That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. ": "sadness", "I just left but I came straight back and paid. All was fine in the end. But I will never go to that restaurant again.": "sadness", "That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in.": "sadness", "I really wanted an Oculus Rift.

I cant tell you, or even begin to explain, how real everything feels when you use it.": "anger", "How much do they go for?": "joy", "It was $400, having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece": "surprise", "thats not bad.

I miss those days smelling my little figurines that smelled like strawberries.": "sadness", "Aw man, childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries.

": "sadness", "my neighbor dog barks all day, I like to go over there and tell him where he can put that dog at,": "anger", "Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?": "anger", "that is the problem, he does nothing, except give me his little mustache smile, one of these days i'll wipe that smile off his face": "anger", "If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.": "disgusted", "I feel so sad to see the world in the state that it is in but I am confident that times are changing and humanity is actually good.": "sadness", "Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.": "anger", "Yes that is true. The ying and the yang. But I think most people are good though.": "anger", "Agreed!": "trust", "My childhood was great. I have mainly positive memories of it.": "sadness", "You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same, sadly.

I do. :)": "sadness", "I decided to try and get some projects knocked out a couple of nights ago, but needed to keep my kids occupied.": "sadness", "what did you end up doing?": "sadness", "Luckily, my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!": "joy", "It's good to have a partner. ": "trust", "My wife took the kids over to her mother's one evening before I got home from work.

When do you hear?": "joy", "Probably next week sometime. I'm really excited!": "joy", "Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?": "joy", "I work in tech support.  One issue I was given the details before and got to do research before I worked with the customer.  It was great knowing what to do before it happened.": "joy", "You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?": "sadness", "yeah! I pretty much knew all the steps that I needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome.": "joy", "That's awesome!

I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.": "joy", "Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes.

It reminded me of my childhood and playing with that toy.": "sadness", "i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.": "joy", "It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!": "sadness", "i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. ": "sadness", "I had a move a couple weekends ago.  I was really planning on getting everything done, or at least moved over, in one weekend.": "sadness", "Moving can be stressful for sure, hopefully you had some help?": "trust", "yeah, the help was great and we did end up getting everything over.  Now the fun part is unpacking the boxes!": "joy", "It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. ": "surprise", "I had a great weekend with my son, we did a ton of fun things.  At the end of the weekend his attitude changed and he didnt want to listen at all.": "sadness", "That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?": "anger", "I made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time": "sadness", "I bet that worked!": "joy", "My dog went number 2 in the middle of the night inside.  The next morning she threw up everything...it was the worst smelling pile of stuff I've ever smelled.": "disgusted", "Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.": "disgusted", "Sorry about that! Yeah, it was a terrible thing to wake up to!": "anger", "I bet, hope the dog is feeling better though.": "sadness", "I used to have a boxer puppy that was so sweet and adorable.  HOwever he had on issue that I could not stand.": "trust", "interesting, what was the issue?": "fear", "Well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor.

She does that sometimes, and just badgers you.  I can't figure out what fires her up.": "anger", "It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.": "joy", "My girlfriend is moving in.  I was pretty calm when we first started talking about it.  I'm really excited but there is so much to pack up!": "joy", "That's exciting! When will she be moving in?": "joy", "In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast, I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her, its just the move that will not be fun": "fear", "Does she live far away?": "sadness", "My wife and I are trying to build a house, and keep running into delays getting the permits.": "anticipation", "That sounds very frustrating.": "anger", "It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out.": "trust", "Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.": "joy", "I was home alone last night playing a VR game.  It took a really creepy turn that I really wasnt expecting at all.": "fear", "It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.

You must miss a lot of things.": "sadness", "I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.": "sadness", "Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.": "sadness", "I slept through a really important class because I was hungover and I failed because of it. I should've behaved better.": "sadness", "That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?": "sadness", "I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that, I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.": "sadness", "No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.": "sadness", "I had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick. I tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible. ": "trust", "That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!": "trust", "He did, he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick, it helps to have someone to care for you.": "trust", "Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!": "sadness", "I once got in a really bad accident on my way home from work and it really upset me": "sadness", "Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?": "sadness", "luckily the only problem I had was my neck was sore for a few weeks but nobody else was hurt": "sadness", "That's good news at least.

She wasnt home and I ended up watching a couple episodes ahead of where we were at.": "sadness", "I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? ": "sadness", "She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean, I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!": "sadness", "Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them. ": "sadness", "I moved last weekend.  I was really happy once everything was done and it went smoothly.": "joy", "That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?": "sadness", "Yeah, unpacking and all that fun stuff now.  I really like the new place though.": "joy", "That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.": "joy", "I'm not in a good mood! My husband got to go to a basketball game. I wish I could have too!": "joy", "Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?": "sadness", "I have to stay home with our son.  It is hard for us to find a baby sitter for him.": "trust", "Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. ": "sadness", "I went to a friend's wedding this weekend!": "joy", "Was it a lot of fun?": "joy", "Oh gosh yes. I wore a beautiful dress. I felt so pretty!": "joy", "That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!": "joy", "Thank you! I feel like a slob lately.": "joy", "It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.": "sadness", "it is nice to have a loving pet , My dog is always there for me": "trust", "What a great feeling! You must love your dog.": "joy", "i really do, no matter what happens, she will always be by my side": "trust", "She sounds like a great companion.": "sadness", "Hello! I started my graduate classes today.": "joy", "Are you looking forward to it?": "joy", "Yes. I have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff.

It's very different from undergraduate": "joy", "I really need to change doctors!": "anticipation", "He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name": "anger", "Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.": "sadness", "Me too.  ": "sadness", "I was playing a VR game home alone.  It took a really creepy turn towards the end of the game.": "fear", "I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.": "sadness", "It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.": "fear", "That would keep me up at night.": "anger", "yesterday i ate a whole big bag of M&Ms, i don't feel proud of myself": "sadness", "Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. ": "sadness", "i hope so, i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed": "sadness", "I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. ": "sadness", "We recently got a new puppy. My older dog waits his turn and knows the puppy should go outside to the bathroom first.": "surprise", "Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.": "trust", "It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.": "surprise", "Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.": "joy", "We've been really struggling with potty training my son.": "joy", "I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.": "sadness", "Thanks, we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night, though!": "sadness", "That is awesome. I am proud of him ": "joy", "I went out with some friends a couple weekends ago and we met a group of girls. One asked for my number but I told her I have a girlfriend and didnt give it out.": "sadness", "gotta risk it for the biscuit": "sadness", "Haha, I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.": "fear", " i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping": "trust", "i have a presentation due this week, I am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others": "joy", "It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!": "fear", "i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others": "fear", "You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.": "sadness", "I felt very bad when my boss did not approve of my work. It just makes me more motivated to work harder.": "sadness", "Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?": "joy", "Yes, I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(": "sadness", "I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.": "fear", "Thank you for your great advice my friend!": "trust", "My roommate moved out and soon my girlfriend will move in but right now it is just me in the house. I dont remember the last time I lived without any roommates.": "sadness", "Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!": "joy", "It does feel a little lonely.  It's weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person.": "sadness", "Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!": "sadness", "I feel so happy when the sunsets are beautiful and I can take the time to watch and relax. It is the best time of the day for me.": "joy", "Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.": "joy", "Yeah, it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world.": "joy", "It reminds you of how beautiful life is.": "sadness", "Man the new guys at work were slandering our boss so bad.": "anger", "Wow, that's rude! He won't last long...": "anger", "I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.": "sadness", "Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!": "fear", "My sister is having another baby! I can't wait to meet her! This will be her fourth child.": "joy", "Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!!

It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!": "surprise", "Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha": "anger", "You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.": "surprise", "There was a random dog in my yard yesterday morning.  He didn't look mean but I wasn't sure I wanted to mess with him.": "sadness", "I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary": "fear", "It was!  I didn't want to chase him off either.  Thankfully he just kind of wandered away.": "fear", "I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.": "trust", "I bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change. She gave me too much change actually. I did not realize until later after I left the store.": "sadness", "Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it": "sadness", "I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.": "sadness", "The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. ": "sadness", "So I was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees.  They were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions.": "sadness", "That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?": "sadness", "My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch.": "sadness", "I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.": "sadness", "So I lost the ring that my best friend gave me when he moved out of country.  We had matching ones made and it's really breaking my heart.": "sadness", "Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap.": "sadness", "It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.": "sadness", "I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.": "sadness", "We had a pretty fun family vacation about a month ago.": "sadness", "Sweet! Where did you go?": "joy", "We went to a lake not far from here.  We had a ton of fun on the boat . . . nobody else was on the water one of the days!": "sadness", "That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!": "joy", "I work in tech support.  Every once in a while a customer will want our software to do something it either cant or is not built for.": "anger", "I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?": "trust", "I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.": "anger", "Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?": "anger", "I had to take my dog to the vet yesterday and I had full confidence they would take care of his problems. They are so good there.": "trust", "oh no! hope all is well with your dog.": "sadness", "Thank you. Other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well. Just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed.": "trust", "Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. ": "joy", "So we went out to that new BBQ place to eat the other night.  ": "surprise", "BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?": "joy", "It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange. ": "fear", "Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.": "sadness", "I really loathe meetings.  They're usually so pointless.": "anger", "i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)": "fear", "That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However, I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!": "joy", "lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. ": "sadness", "Oh man.  I was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy!": "disgusted", "That's terrible! What did you do?": "sadness", "I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.": "sadness", "That's good. I'm glad your alright.": "trust", "Once in Kindergarten, a pair of my underwear got stuck in my shirt and fell out in the middle of the classroom.": "sadness", "Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. ": "sadness", "I was! I thought I was going to get in trouble": "sadness", "Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you": "sadness", "the other day I was looking at old pictures of a car i use to own. I miss that car.": "sadness", "What kind of car was it?": "surprise", "i was an old Cadillac, reason I miss it, lot of memories of family and friends riding in it": "sadness", "Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it": "surprise", "i just lost my pet dog. I do not know what to do.": "sadness", "OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?": "sadness", "i cannot find her anywhere, she is missing, it feels like I have a part of me missing ": "anger", "I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.": "sadness", "It was wonderful not having to worry about my most recent exam, knowing I was prepared.": "joy", "Good job! How do you think you did on it?": "joy", "I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.": "joy", "That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!": "joy", "I packed for a long road trip, and had everything I would need to hopefully avoid excessive stops. ": "joy", "Yeah I like going straight to the point too": "joy", "Definitely. Nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn't pack enough food and didn't plan bathroom breaks.": "anger", "I like when I get places earlier than expected": "joy", "I had a dentist appointment yesterday.  I hate going to the dentist!": "fear", "I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?": "sadness", "Yes I had to get a filling in my very back tooth.  THe dentist said I had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if I started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve.   I was scared the whole time.": "fear", "That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!": "fear", "My son wouldnt sleep last night.  He kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room.": "anger", "Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?": "fear", "He just didnt want to sleep. I think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point.": "anger", "Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!": "anger", "My son graduated pre-school.  It isnt much but its that next step in his school career.": "joy", "That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college ": "joy", "Haha, I hope not too soon!  I was really happy, he is growing pretty fast!": "joy", "College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.": "sadness", "I'm going to a beer dabbler this weekend.  It has been very busy the last couple weeks so I'm really looking forward to drinking and relaxing this weekend.": "joy", "That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind": "joy", "I think so.  I'm hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!": "joy", "I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.": "anticipation", "I'm trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room.  I know he wants to be by me and I can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights": "fear", "That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.": "sadness", "I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!": "anger", "Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.": "anger", "i do love my pet doggy, she is a treat to have": "trust", "That is so sweet. What is her name?": "surprise", "Angie, i like to give her a warm bath, dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat": "sadness", "I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.": "trust", "We just got a new puppy.  My older dog knew to let that one out first when I got home from work.": "joy", "That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. ": "trust", "Definitely not.  I was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!": "surprise", "That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.": "sadness", "I used to have my dog in his crate when I left for work.  Lately I have been letting him out more and more in the house when I've been gone.": "sadness", "That's good. How is it going?": "joy", "It's going well!  So far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything.": "anger", "That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it. ": "joy", "I was driving down the road and I almost hit a dog! I was so close. Really scary!": "fear", "I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?": "sadness", "Yes, he came out of nowhere and I slammed on my brakes. My tires skid across the road.": "fear", "I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.": "fear", "I finished all the ice cream when I was told to leave some for others. I was just so hungry!": "joy", "lol, guess you were pretty hungry": "sadness", "Yeah, now I am scared somebody will find out. I better go buy some more before anyone gets home. Haha": "fear", "yeah, might wanna go replace it": "sadness", "I am the happiest in my life when I am at the ocean. There is just something so special about nature at the ocean for me.": "joy", "That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?": "joy", "I don't really have a favorite. They are all my favorite! But I prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything. Like a huge swimming pool! ": "joy", "Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.": "joy", "I saw Dubai from the airplane one day. I never went into the city, but wow, it was a sight to see!": "surprise", "i sure it was beautiful": "joy", "It looked like another planet or something. Very sci-fi.

How gross!!!": "disgusted", "yuck, how gross!!": "disgusted", "Yeah, who does that?

She's got this!!": "joy", "I don't have many friends and my family lives very far away. I sometimes feel very sad.": "sadness", "why do you live so far from family": "sadness", "It is just where I ended up in life. You know one thing leads to another and your living a whole knew life.": "sadness", "i would like a new life. i totally understand": "sadness", "I heard a really loud bang in the middle of the night. the next morning I found out that it was gun shots.

I live in the country and have the same problem.": "fear", "It always happens when there are electrical storms. It seems to be storm season around here.": "fear", "Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.": "surprise", "I feel very blessed that I have been able to live around the world my whole life. Now I am settled in one place for awhile.": "trust", "That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?": "joy", "My father was in the military so I lived all over the world my first 20 years of life. My favorite place is Spain.": "joy", "What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too. ": "sadness", "My guinea pig had 5 babies but all of them died. I don't know why...": "sadness", "That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.": "sadness", "Yeah, it is terrible. I just wish I knew why but oh well. She will have more babies in a couple months.

But I trust him that he will be a good boy.": "trust", "Well I'm sure he will be, most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.": "trust", "Yeah. I was in a bad relationship before with a man that was extremely untrustworthy so sometimes I get a bit crazy sometimes. ": "sadness", "Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.": "anger", "I get so upset when someone does not agree with what I am doing. I am a grown women and feel I can make good choices for myself.": "sadness", "Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong": "disgusted", "Yes, it is like they don't have a life of their own and want to control others lives.

My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.": "sadness", "I know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but I just can't help it. Maybe I need a therapist.": "sadness", "I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much. ": "sadness", "I made a stupid mistake at work and I got fired. What am I going to do?": "sadness", "Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once.

Can you tell me a great story about the party?": "sadness", "Sure can!   Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol, so needless to say we were all drunk.   We attempted to play darts.   Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall.  THe house was trashed when my parents returned.  Years later I feel bad about it still.": "sadness", "Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.": "sadness", "i envy my sister, she is going on vacation in Paris": "anger", "Wow, cool.

He probably loves you so much": "joy", "i was upset at myself for sleeping in so late this morning": "anger", "Do you feel nice and refreshed though?": "joy", "yes definitely!": "surprise", "I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!": "sadness", "I dropped my iPod touch on the bathroom floor.": "sadness", "Oh no! Did it break?": "sadness", "Unfortunately yes. The screen shattered and I went for over a month without music.": "sadness", "Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.": "sadness", "My guinea pig was feeling very sick but I was able to nurse her back to health.": "trust", "Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?": "fear", "No, I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals.

She is alright now!": "trust", "Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!": "joy", "After training my dog I feel confident now that he can be around others dogs without fighting.": "joy", "That is good, how long did it take before you go him to this point?": "joy", "It took about a month. I think it was quicker but I was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out.": "fear", "Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though": "sadness", "my next door neighbor just bought a Mercedes, I wish i can have one.": "anger", "Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?": "anger", "really cannot afford one, but the neighbor can, he is always buying expensive stuff, last month he bought a speed boat.": "anger", "sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. ": "sadness", "Last week I had a argument with my son, he really said some mean things to me. I thought I raised him better.": "sadness", "Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment": "sadness", "It really hurt my feelings. I wish he would've handled it better. I'm more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said.": "sadness", "well maybe you guys should talk": "sadness", "I told him I was disappointed in his actions, but I still love him. We all make mistakes.": "sadness", "My roommate cooked some really foul smelling meat last night, I had to leave or I was going to puke.": "disgusted", "Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.": "disgusted", "Exactly! I had to air out the place for a couple hours after.": "joy", "Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now": "disgusted", "I used the restroom at a nice restaurant and I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe and didn't know it until I left.

I did not know if I would pass or not.": "fear", "I took mine last summer I was nervous also. My heat was racing the whole time.

Maybe I should move to the city where there are more opportunities.": "sadness", "I think cities are more expensive, like living costs, so I do not want to live there ether personally": "anticipation", "Yeah, you are right my friend. :)": "sadness", "i believed my friend would return my cell phone to me in time": "trust", "I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time.

Good job": "joy", "I have all my ingredients for my dinner party and now I am getting ready to prepare a feast!": "joy", "You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning, and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.": "joy", "Yeah, we all have different personalities. But you would come to a dinner party if invited, right?": "sadness", "I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of \"rescue me\" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max": "sadness", "I broke one of my mom's crystal figurine, I tried hard not to tell her but in the end I felt so bad I had to tell her.": "sadness", "Aw, that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.": "sadness", "Yes, she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though. ": "sadness", "Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.": "anger", "Honestly that is such a wonderful idea!": "sadness", "I feel happy to know that God has got my back and I don't have to worry about anything.": "joy", "I am right there with you!  God is good and wow, He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.": "joy", "Oh yes. He is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! He will never let us down. Even when we think He has we should only think it is something that I need to learn and He is so caring that He wants to teach me.": "trust", "Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!": "joy", "I miss how we all used to celebrate Christmas when I was a child. It was such a warm and cozy time. Things are really changing in this high tech modern world.": "sadness", "They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.": "sadness", "Yeah, so you remember all those wonderful old Christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between.

So many memories!": "sadness", "In July, I found a large moth inside a cottage that my brother and friends were staying at.": "sadness", "Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?": "surprise", "It was as big as a small bird, I was super surprised. It was furry and white all over.

I hope your plants grow beautifully!": "joy", "Thanks!! :)": "joy", "After feeling depressed for days, I took the time to sit outside in the sun and have a nice chit chat with my mom.": "sadness", "That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.": "sadness", "Thank you for your kind words, it means a lot really. And yeah the cool breeze felt so comforting, it completely changed my mood!": "sadness", "I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!": "trust", "There may be a hurricane in my area soon I am kind of scared.": "fear", "I imagine, are you prepared for it?": "joy", "Not yet, but I will start preparing.

Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.": "sadness", "i forgot to pay my credit card bill, I'm so disappointed with myself.": "sadness", "I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.": "fear", "Yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things.  I hope they don't charge an overdraft fee.": "anger", "I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.": "anger", "i have a presentation tomorrow.

You will do great!": "joy", "I once called my girlfriend's mother mom by accident.": "sadness", "Haha, I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.": "sadness", "Exactly, especially since we were only dating for a few months! I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.": "sadness", "Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.": "sadness", "The pigeons keep coming into the house a pooping all over the place!": "disgusted", "That's gross, why are they coming in?": "disgusted", "Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.": "sadness", "You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.": "disgusted", "No better I just put some screen on my windows, lol.": "anger", "Oh, I am so sad that my family could not come and visit me. I miss them all so much. Why is life so busy for everyone these days?": "sadness", "I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you, it is very sad.": "sadness", "Family should come first, right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up!": "sadness", "Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.": "sadness", "Recently I had a very good customer service experience with my cable company.

Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!": "trust", "My dog eats other animals poop. I have seen them eat goat, duck and cow poop.

It seems no one was hurt except the cow. :( The car was pretty damaged though.": "sadness", "At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow. ": "sadness", "my pet dog is getting older. I know one day she won't be around anymore": "sadness", "Just cherish the moments": "sadness", "I will, but just the thought of it makes me blue": "sadness", "It will be okay": "fear", "I put in a lot of effort and energy and I found a new job!": "joy", "What kind of job is it": "joy", "It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself. ": "joy", "That is a nice job I am sure": "joy", "I came home drunk from the bar and stole my neighbor's package that was sitting out.": "anger", "Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?": "anger", "No, but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.": "sadness", "That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.": "sadness", "With all the money I've been saving up, I should be able to purchase an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality system soon!": "anticipation", "Awesome, congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift, is there a particular game you're eager to play?": "joy", "Hmm maybe Robo Recall, a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!": "joy", "Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!": "joy", "I went on a new bike trail the other day, it was super fun but also a little scary.": "fear", "Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?": "fear", "Yep, exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike, I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.": "fear", "I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?": "joy", "Absolutely! And now that I know it better, I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday, can't wait!": "fear", "I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!": "joy", "I made a new friend at a convention I was volunteering at. I was shocked.": "surprise", "What kind of con was it": "sadness", "Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime, Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).": "surprise", "that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that": "joy", "That's a shame. Anyways, I haven't made any friends in well over a year because I'm awful in social situations.": "sadness", "I participated in a ropes course with my colleagues, we had to learn how to trust each other.": "trust", "That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?": "joy", "Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall, but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.": "trust", "Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.": "trust", "I let my little sister go into my wallet and grab my credit card so she can order something online for herself.": "trust", "Why did you do tht?": "sadness", "She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.": "trust", "That makes sense, you are a good older sibling!": "trust", "Thanks for the compliment! But she's also a great younger sibling!": "trust", " I once drank six pints of beer in a night and ended up getting very sick.": "sadness", "I would imagine, that is a lot to drink!": "disgusted", "It really is. I felt so bad about my actions, but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.": "sadness", "I get that, well I hope you feel betternow!": "sadness", "I never learned how to ride a bike.": "joy", "My parents never saw the importance I guess. ": "sadness", "I get that, did your friends know how to ride bikes?": "anger", "They did, but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.": "sadness", "Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot": "sadness", "My girlfriend made the cutest and most touching card for my birthday.": "sadness", "Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?": "sadness", "I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.": "sadness", "Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol": "sadness", "My cat has terminal kidney failure. There's no cure.": "sadness", "Oh, I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... ": "sadness", "It really sucks. It's fairly common in cats and I sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn't make it any easier. I'm sorry to hear about your dog.": "sadness", "Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.": "sadness", "I received horrific news from a best friend recently.": "sadness", "Oh no,  what happened?": "sadness", "They had tried to commit suicide. It was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need.": "sadness", "That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs.": "sadness", "you know at work, one of my coworker is always singing to himself, it bugs me": "anger", "Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.": "anger", "it really is, he thinks he knows how to sing, i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing ": "anger", "He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.": "joy", "One time I slipped on a banana peel": "sadness", "Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!": "sadness", "Yep, everyone was laughing at me": "sadness", "I'm sorry but I probably would have, too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!": "sadness", "My neighbor was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad form of cancer.": "sadness", "That is unfortunate, is he doing any chemotherapy ?": "sadness", "I'm not entirely sure of the regimen, I didn't want to ask too many questions. But I've been bringing pre-cooked meals over for her and her husband when I get a chance to help them out a little.": "sadness", "Well I hope everything works out for him!": "anger", "One time I was waiting all day for the mail man to deliver my package": "anticipation", "What were you waiting for!": "joy", "I was waiting for my computer monitor!": "anger", "Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!": "joy", "I ran out of laundry soap the other day, when I went to the store I grabbed a brand I hadn't used in many years.": "sadness", "How well did it work out for you?": "joy", "Oh it worked fine, but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?": "sadness", "Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!": "sadness", "Right? I didn't expect that could happen with laundry soap!": "surprise", "One time I saw my husband looking at another women": "anger", "o no what did you do?": "sadness", "I slapped him and beat up the other women": "anger", "o no im not sure that was the best response": "sadness", "I was leaving the bar the other day with my boyfriend and tripped on the step just outside the door.": "sadness", "Oh No! Did you get hurt?": "sadness", "Well, physically not so much, just a light scrape on my knee. But man my pride got wounded bad!": "sadness", "I bet that was a little embarrassing. ": "sadness", "I was a cigarette smoker for nearly an entire decade. In retrospect this is slightly embarrassing. ": "sadness", "Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it": "sadness", "Right. Not much that can be done about it now. I enjoy having more money now though for sure!": "sadness", "That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!": "joy", "Being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as I expected it to be. My daughter is awesome!": "joy", "That is great to hear that things are going well for you.": "joy", "Thanks that means a lot to me!": "sadness", "I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.": "joy", "I was waiting to hear back about a potential job offer, I really wanted the job.": "anticipation", "How long has it been since the interview?": "joy", "That's the thing, my anxiety and excitement started the moment I first talked to the company, it was driving me crazy. But I ended up getting the job!": "fear", "Oh well congrats and good job!": "joy", "My friend just won $500 in scratch-off lottery tickets!": "surprise", "Oh that is awesome for your friend!": "trust", "Oh totally. I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious, I hate to admit.": "anger", "Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.": "sadness", "Well good, I don't feel so bad about it then. I thought I was being a bad friend!": "sadness", "I took on a challenging speed bike course recently that was above my skill level.": "joy", "That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?": "sadness", "It actually worked out amazing! I knew going into it that I'd practiced a lot and had built up my skills, so I was sure I could do it even if I was a little hesitant.": "fear", "Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.": "fear", "When I was interviewing for a promotion at my job. I did all I could to get ready for the interview. ": "joy", "That can be kind of scary. How did it go?": "fear", "It went great. I having put in all the work ahead of time to get ready, I knew exactly how to answer the questions they had for me. ": "joy", "Awesome, congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.": "joy", "At my job a coworker took credit for a job I had completed. Once I found out, I went straight to my boss and got it straightened out.": "anger", "Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up": "anger", "I found them and gave them a piece of my mind. What kind of person does something like that.": "trust", "For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it, most people dont'": "trust", "We went camping this summer and my boyfriend made fun of me for packing so much stuff.": "joy", "Aww haha how many bags did you bring": "sadness", "It honestly wasn't *that* much stuff, I packed it well. But the joke's on him, he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and I just so happened to pack one.": "sadness", "Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one": "joy", "This couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night!": "joy", "That sounds awful!": "disgusted", "Yeah, it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on, every single night? It's really ticking me off.": "anger", "Have you tried talking to them about it?": "anger", "Yes, I casually mentioned condo rules on noise and asked them to at least try and keep it down on weekdays.": "sadness", "An actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! I didn't think they still exist.": "sadness", "I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!": "sadness", "Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!": "sadness", "I loved that too!": "sadness", "I am content with my life. I have nothing to complain about, luckily!": "joy", "That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.": "trust", "Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok!": "fear", "Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.": "anger", "I was cleaning out the attic last week, and came across a box of old photo albums and some of my childhood things. I sat for hours just looking at old photos.": "sadness", "Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. ": "sadness", "It really did. Seeing all those old faces I haven't seen for years. It was a great experience.": "joy", "Did you share it with anyone else?": "sadness", "I recently applied for a job with a  new company. It would be such a step up for my family if I got it.": "anticipation", "Nice, a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?": "joy", "Some, I did well in the interview. Just trying to keep spirits up while they make their decision.": "anticipation", "Well I hope you get it. Good luck!": "joy", "I'm waiting to hear about a lucrative job opportunity, it would pretty much be my dream job.": "anticipation", "That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?": "joy", "Not sure, hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.": "joy", "I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.": "fear", "Most of the decisions that I made as a teenager were kind of embarrassing in retrospect.": "sadness", "I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery": "disgusted", "I feel it. Most of the bad decisions were fun, at least.": "trust", "Ha YOLOOO": "sadness", "I can't wait until all the trees change colors and the weather starts getting cold. I love Autumn!": "joy", "I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season, too?": "joy", "Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.": "surprise", "I don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall.": "joy", "I worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed.": "sadness", "Awe, sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.": "sadness", "Well, not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.": "sadness", "That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!": "joy", "The house is all cleaned and ready for my guests. Wow, I was cleaning all day!": "joy", "I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?": "joy", "Yes, there is no better satisfaction, in my opinion, than a clean house. :) My sister is visiting with her kids. They are staying for a week here at my house. I am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end.": "anger", "I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.": "anger", "My neighbor sits out on his balcony butt naked sometimes.": "anger", "That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?": "anger", "No but that might be a good idea. It's just an awkward and gross situation.": "disgusted", "I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.": "anger", "I have fixed up house to the best of my ability. I feel very certain that it will sell very quickly.": "joy", "I certainly hope so,  Why do you want to move?": "sadness", "I am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier. Less house to clean and more time outside. :)": "joy", "That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.": "joy", "I feel confident that eating a fruitarian diet will give me more energy and happiness.": "joy", "Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?": "joy", "I have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life. There is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit..": "joy", "Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!": "joy", "I wrote an email to a family member I haven't spoken to in a long time and I wasn't sure how they'd take everything I said in it.": "sadness", "Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?": "trust", "Yep, it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up!": "fear", "Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!": "surprise", "I get so mad when the local kids throw eggs at the front doors of houses in my neighborhood. It is so infuriating!": "anger", "Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun ": "anger", "Yeah! I wish I had the time for it! I am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act. I am going to teach them a lesson! But I love the paintball idea! That is great! ": "joy", "Yup gotta lay down the law": "anger", "I moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night.": "fear", "Terrifying! What was it?": "sadness", "It turned out to be the sump pump, I guess it was old. But yes, it scared the daylights out of me!": "fear", "Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?": "trust", "I did, yeah. It was actually still in working condition but I couldn't stand the sound and I'm a light sleeper. No more scary noises at 3am!": "fear", "I made a really inappropriate joke about a coworker to some other people I work with and it got back to him.": "sadness", "Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?": "sadness", "No, but the person who told him confessed. So I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand. He actually wasn't that upset and appreciated that I owned up to it, but I still felt bad for it, mostly that I did it behind his back.": "sadness", "That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.": "sadness", "I got my work done early on Friday so I got to spend the day trying out a new bike trail on my new bike!": "joy", "that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?": "joy", "I've only recently started getting really into it. It sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really... satisfying. Calm.": "joy", "Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!": "joy", "I miss being able to take my children to the park.": "sadness", "How come you can't take them anymore?": "sadness", "they are all grown up. ": "sadness", "Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!": "sadness", "I studied all night for my final exam\"": "joy", "That's intense. I hope you did well!": "fear", "I did! I got an A and I am so proud and happy !": "joy", "Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved": "joy", "the neighbor's dog barked all night and kept me up, let's say I am not very happy right now": "anger", "I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!": "sadness", "i understand the dog is being a dog, but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it": "sadness", "Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them": "anticipation", "My cat somehow figured out how to open the cabinet and stole a bag of treats.": "disgusted", "Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.": "sadness", "Right? I wasn't even mad about it, I was astounded by his ingenuity.": "anger", "That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.": "surprise", "Well he also taught himself how to use a toilet so who knows!": "disgusted", "I feel like my husband is the sweetest man in the world": "trust", "That is great! Hopefully he continues to be": "trust", "I think he will. He puts up with me, and sometimes i can be a pill!": "fear", "Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even": "sadness", "I was so upset when I had to put my dog down last month": "sadness", "Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?": "sadness", "Not really. She was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs. It was very sad.": "sadness", "I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.": "sadness", "During my first year in grad school, my basement apartment flooded. EVERYTHING was destroyed and I had to start over fresh.": "sadness", "That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?": "anger", "Thankfully, yes!! It took several months to replace everything that I could -- but even things, so many things I just simply couldn't replace. ": "sadness", "Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. ": "sadness", "I am in charge of booking meeting rooms for outside companies at my job. Last week, I made a big mistake and accidentally gave a group a room for free when they should've paid $100.": "sadness", "Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!": "sadness", "Thankfully, not too much! I was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and I managed to mess that one up so badly!": "sadness", "To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!": "sadness", "My brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight.": "joy", "Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?": "sadness", "I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun, we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.": "surprise", "Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.": "sadness", "Thank you so very much! I appreciate the sentiment.": "sadness", "I drank a lot and told my girlfriend that I would definitely sleep with her best friend if she was down to do so.": "trust", "What was her reaction to that": "sadness", "She was a little sad and surprised, but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless, I felt very ashamed the next day.": "sadness", "I am sure she will forgive you": "sadness", "She already has. We both think of these type of things so all is good.": "sadness", "My husband and I have been watching TV together each night--once the baby is asleep, of course.": "joy", "That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time": "joy", "It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together, just us. ": "sadness", "Have you ever passed out together watching tv?": "joy", "Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point!": "sadness", "How old is your baby?": "trust", "8 months old - but by looking at him, you'd think he was a two-year-old. Thanks for asking!": "sadness", "And how long have you been married?": "trust", "My wife and I found the perfect house for sale and we excited to put a bid in on it.": "anticipation", "that is exciting! will it be your first house?": "joy", "Well it would have been, but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.": "sadness", "that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one": "sadness", "I let my friend watch my dog last weekend.": "trust", "You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?": "trust", "It was good, he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!": "surprise", "Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?": "trust", "Absolutely. He has proved himself to be trustworthy when it comes to important stuff.": "surprise", "I once almost ruined my husband's master's thesis presentation--something he needed to pass to get his degree.": "joy", "Oh no, what did you do?": "sadness", "I started coughing--badly. He and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay. He was so distracted after that!": "sadness", "Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.": "anger", "I was expecting a surprise birthday party today.": "surprise", "Lol that makes a lot of sense?": "joy", "Yeah I had a few hints. My expectations were somewhat true; my brother's friend celebrated not only my birthday party, but two other birthdays today. It was wonderful!": "surprise", "well that sounds fun!": "joy", "It really was. I was so happy!": "joy", "Last week while my wife were out for dinner at a restaurant, I got up to use the restroom and walked by the kitchen. I saw a cook pick up a piece of chicken off the floor and put it back on someone's plate.": "disgusted", "Haha caught red handed!": "sadness", "We proceeded to leave the restaurant, but not after informing the manager, very loudly, about the incident. ": "disgusted", "Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service": "disgusted", "I hope I do well when I start school soon, I can't help but think it will be too hard.": "joy", "Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.": "fear", "Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.": "joy", "Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!": "sadness", "Thanks lol. I wish I could type this well at 6 years old.": "sadness", "My husband's been searching for a professional job but can't seem to land one after interviewing.": "joy", "Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?": "sadness", "Well, he has a masters degree and graduate certificate already. He's had a fourth interview for a position last Thursday -- so we are hoping this one will finally be the one!": "anticipation", "That is a good news. I hope he get it.": "joy", "Last month my son had to have surgery to have his tonsils removed.": "trust", "Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young": "fear", "Yeah, I was terrified. I just wandering around the waiting room the entire time till they came and told me everything went fine. Seemed like it took days.": "fear", "I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still": "fear", "Isn't it nice when people bring you food, when you've had a long day?": "trust", "Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day": "surprise", "Exactly! My boyfriend brought me dinner the other night. I had no groceries and just didn't feel like going out after a long stressful day. I was so thankful.": "trust", "Were at work today or doing something else?": "sadness", "My little sister has been going all across the country this summer, spending lots of time on money on pop concert after pop concert.": "surprise", "Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?": "anger", "Mostly I'm a bit frustrated that she's got so much money to blow on these concerts! And to travel all across the country!": "anger", "Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.": "anger", "During this past spring during a bad storm, we had a tornado touch down in my neighbors yard.": "joy", "Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!": "fear", "It sounded like a train going by the house from the basement. Thankfully no one was hurt.": "fear", "Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.": "fear", "I don't like joining it when people talk about someone that's not there, just like what happened yesterday.": "sadness", "Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened? ": "anger", "He was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes. While I may agree I just don't like talking behind someones back.": "anger", "Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that. ": "surprise", "Yeah I feel like not everyone is as moral as me. But that's pretentious which is ironically amoral.": "anger", "I work at a library cataloging materials and am often asked to help my coworkers--it makes me feel like an expert, though I'm not.": "trust", "Sounds like your co workers respect you then": "trust", "They seem to. Or, at least, they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions!": "anger", "Or that as well ha": "sadness", "When I was a young kid, I stole some comic books from the local grocery store.": "sadness", "Did you ever get caught?": "sadness", "My mother found out and made me walk them back into the store and give them to the manager. That was a humbling experience.": "sadness", "Was she disappointed?": "sadness", "When I went into labor with my son, it was quite the ordeal.
